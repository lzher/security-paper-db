    "author": "Zhang, Changjian and Garlan, David and Kang, Eunsuk",
    "abstract": "Software systems are designed and implemented with assumptions about the environment. However, once the system is deployed, the actual environment may deviate from its expected behavior, possibly undermining desired properties of the system. To enable systematic design of systems that are robust against potential environmental deviations, we propose a rigorous notion of robustness for software systems. In particular, the robustness of a system is defined as the largest set of deviating environmental behaviors under which the system is capable of guaranteeing a desired property. We describe a new set of design analysis problems based on our notion of robustness, and a technique for automatically computing robustness of a system given its behavior description. We demonstrate potential applications of our robustness notion on two case studies involving network protocols and safety-critical interfaces.",

    "author": "Badihi, Sahar and Akinotcho, Faridah and Li, Yi and Rubin, Julia",
    "abstract": "Equivalence checking techniques help establish whether two versions of a program exhibit the same behavior. The majority of popular techniques for formally proving/refuting equivalence relies on symbolic execution ‚Äì a static analysis approach that reasons about program behaviors in terms of symbolic input variables. Yet, symbolic execution is difficult to scale in practice due to complex programming constructs, such as loops and non-linear arithmetic.  This paper proposes an approach, named ARDiff, for improving the scalability of symbolic-execution-based equivalence checking techniques when comparing syntactically-similar versions of a program, e.g., for verifying the correctness of code upgrades and refactoring. Our approach relies on a set of novel heuristics to determine which parts of the versions‚Äô common code can be effectively pruned during the analysis, reducing the analysis complexity without sacrificing its effectiveness. Furthermore, we devise a new equivalence checking benchmark, extending existing benchmarks with a set of real-life methods containing complex math functions and loops. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ARDiff on this benchmark and show that it outperforms existing method-level equivalence checking techniques by solving 86\\% of all equivalent and 55\\% of non-equivalent cases, compared with 47\\% to 69\\% for equivalent and 38\\% to 52\\% for non-equivalent cases in related work.",

    "abstract": "Formal program specifications are essential for various software engineering tasks, such as program verification, program synthesis, code debugging and software testing. However, manually inferring formal program specifications is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. In addition, it requires substantial expertise. Natural language comments contain rich semantics about behaviors of code, making it feasible to infer program specifications from comments. Inspired by this, we develop a tool, named C2S, to automate the specification synthesis task by translating natural language comments into formal program specifications. Our approach firstly constructs alignments between natural language word and specification tokens from existing comments and their corresponding specifications. Then for a given method comment, our approach assembles tokens that are associated with words in the comment from the alignments into specifications guided by specification syntax and the context of the target method. Our tool successfully synthesizes 1,145 specifications for 511 methods of 64 classes in 5 different projects, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art. The generated specifications are also used to improve a number of software engineering tasks like static taint analysis, which demonstrates the high quality of the specifications.",

    "author": "Zhang, Mingxue and Meng, Wei",
    "abstract": "JavaScript is widely used for implementing client-side web applications, and it is common to include JavaScript code from many different hosts. However, in a web browser, all the scripts loaded in the same frame share a single global namespace. As a result, a script may read or even overwrite the global objects or functions in other scripts, causing unexpected behaviors. For example, a script can redefine a function in a different script as an object, so that any call of that function would cause an exception at run time.  We systematically investigate the client-side JavaScript code integrity problem caused by JavaScript global identifier conflicts in this paper. We developed a browser-based analysis framework, JSObserver, to collect and analyze the write operations to global memory locations by JavaScript code. We identified three categories of conflicts using JSObserver on the Alexa top 100K websites, and detected 145,918 conflicts on 31,615 websites.  We reveal that JavaScript global identifier conflicts are prevalent and could cause behavior deviation at run time. In particular, we discovered that 1,611 redefined functions were called after being overwritten, and many scripts modified the value of cookies or redefined cookie-related functions. Our research demonstrated that JavaScript global identifier conflict is an emerging threat to both the web users and the integrity of web applications.",

    "author": "Beyer, Dirk and Friedberger, Karlheinz",
    "abstract": "Whenever a new software-verification technique is developed, additional effort is necessary to extend the new program analysis to an interprocedural one, such that it supports recursive procedures. We would like to reduce that additional effort. Our contribution is an approach to extend an existing analysis in a modular and domain-independent way to an interprocedural analysis without large changes: We present interprocedural block-abstraction memoization (BAM), which is a technique for procedure summarization to analyze (recursive) procedures. For recursive programs, a fix-point algorithm terminates the recursion if every procedure is sufficiently unrolled and summarized to cover the abstract state space.  BAM Interprocedural works for data-flow analysis and for model checking, and is independent from the underlying abstract domain. To witness that our interprocedural analysis is generic and configurable, we defined and evaluated the approach for three completely different abstract domains: predicate abstraction, explicit values, and intervals. The interprocedural BAM-based analysis is implemented in the open-source verification framework CPAchecker. The evaluation shows that the overhead for modularity and domain-independence is not prohibitively large and the analysis is still competitive with other state-of-the-art software-verification tools.",

    "abstract": "Today, most developers bundle changes into commits that they submit to a shared code repository. Tangled commits intermix distinct concerns, such as a bug fix and a new feature. They cause issues for developers, reviewers, and researchers alike: they restrict the usability of tools such as git bisect, make patch comprehension more difficult, and force researchers who mine software repositories to contend with noise. We present a novel data structure, the ùõø-NFG, a multiversion Program Dependency Graph augmented with name flows. A ùõø-NFG directly and simultaneously encodes different program versions, thereby capturing commits, and annotates data flow edges with the names/lexemes that flow across them. Our technique, Flexeme, builds a ùõø-NFG from commits, then applies Agglomerative Clustering using Graph Similarity to that ùõø-NFG to untangle its commits. At the untangling task on a C# corpus, our implementation, Heddle, improves the state-of-the-art on accuracy by 0.14, achieving 0.81, in a fraction of the time: Heddle is 32 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Vacuity is a well-known quality issue in formal specifications, studied mostly in the context of model checking. Inherent vacuity is a type of vacuity that applies to specifications, without the context of a model. GR(1) is an expressive assume-guarantee fragment of LTL, which enables efficient symbolic synthesis.  In this work we investigate inherent vacuity for GR(1) specifications. We define several general types of inherent vacuity for GR(1), including specification element vacuity and domain value vacuity. We detect vacuities using a reduction to LTL satisfiability, specialized for the context of GR(1). We further extend vacuity detection to handle GR(1) specifications that are enriched with past LTL, monitors, and patterns. Finally, we define a novel notion of vacuity core, which provides means to localize the cause of vacuity.  We implemented our work and evaluated it on benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation shows that vacuities are indeed common in GR(1) specifications, and that we are able to efficiently detect them and effectively localize their causes. Moreover, our evaluation shows that removal of vacuous specification elements may significantly reduce synthesis time.",

However, the performance depends heavily on the quality of collected examples. In many cases, only after tens or even hundreds of constraint queries, can a feasible invariant be successfully inferred. To reduce the gigantic number of constraint queries and improve the performance of black-box learning, we introduce interval counterexamples into the learning framework. Each interval counterexample represents a set of counterexamples from constraint solvers. We propose three different generalization techniques to compute interval counterexamples. The existing decision tree algorithm is also improved to adapt interval counterexamples.

    "abstract": "Merging execution paths is a powerful technique for reducing path explosion in symbolic execution. One approach, introduced and dubbed ‚Äúveritesting‚Äù by Avgerinos et al., works by translating abounded control flow region into a single constraint. This approach is a convenient way to achieve path merging as a modification to a pre-existing single-path symbolic execution engine. Previous work evaluated this approach for symbolic execution of binary code, but different design considerations apply when building tools for other languages. In this paper, we extend the previous approach for symbolic execution of Java.  Because Java code typically contains many small dynamically dispatched methods, it is important to include them in multi-path regions; we introduce dynamic inlining of method-regions to do so modularly. Java‚Äôs typed memory structure is very different from the binary representation, but we show how the idea of static single assignment (SSA) form can be applied to object references to statically account for aliasing. We have implemented our algorithms in Java Ranger, an extension to the widely used Symbolic Pathfinder tool. In a set of nine benchmarks, Java Ranger reduces the running time and number of execution paths by a total of 38\\% and 71\\% respectively as compared to SPF. Our results are a significant improvement over the performance of JBMC, a recently released verification tool for Java bytecode.

    "abstract": "Modern software is bloated. Demand for new functionality has led developers to include more and more features, many of which become unneeded or unused as software evolves. This phenomenon, known as software bloat, results in software consuming more resources than it otherwise needs to. How to effectively and automatically debloat software is a long-standing problem in software engineering. Various debloating techniques have been proposed since the late 1990s. However, many of these techniques are built upon pure static analysis and have yet to be extended and evaluated in the context of modern Java applications where dynamic language features are prevalent.  To this end, we develop an end-to-end bytecode debloating framework called JShrink. It augments traditional static reachability analysis with dynamic profiling and type dependency analysis and renovates existing bytecode transformations to account for new language features in modern Java. We highlight several nuanced technical challenges that must be handled properly and examine behavior preservation of debloated software via regression testing. We find that (1) JShrink is able to debloat our real-world Java benchmark suite by up to 47\\% (14\\% on average); (2) accounting for dynamic language features is indeed crucial to ensure behavior preservation---reducing 98\\% of test failures incurred by a purely static equivalent, Jax, and 84\\% for ProGuard; and (3) compared with purely dynamic approaches, integrating static analysis with dynamic profiling makes the debloated software more robust to unseen test executions---in 22 out of 26 projects, the debloated software ran successfully under new tests.",

Based on this observation, HOMI aims to minimize the total number of states while keeping ‚Äúpromising‚Äù states during symbolic execution. We identify promising states by a learning algorithm that continuously updates the probabilistic pruning strategy based on data accumulated during the testing process.

    "abstract": "Software verification approaches aim to check a software component under analysis for all possible environments. In reality, however, components are expected to operate within a larger system and are required to satisfy their requirements only when their inputs are constrained by environment assumptions. In this paper, we propose EPIcuRus, an approach to automatically synthesize environment assumptions for a component under analysis (i.e., conditions on the component inputs under which the component is guaranteed to satisfy its requirements). EPIcuRus combines search-based testing, machine learning and model checking. The core of EPIcuRus is a decision tree algorithm that infers environment assumptions from a set of test results including test cases and their verdicts. The test cases are generated using search-based testing, and the assumptions inferred by decision trees are validated through model checking. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the assumption generation process, we propose a novel test case generation technique, namely Important Features Boundary Test (IFBT), that guides the test generation based on the feedback produced by machine learning. We evaluated EPIcuRus by assessing its effectiveness in computing assumptions on a set of study subjects that include 18 requirements of four industrial models. We show that, for each of the 18 requirements, EPIcuRus was able to compute an assumption to ensure the satisfaction of that requirement, and further, ‚âà78\\% of these assumptions were computed in one hour.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining large code bases written in dynamically typed languages, such as JavaScript or Python, can be challenging due to the absence of type annotations: simple data compatibility errors proliferate, IDE support is limited, and APIs are hard to comprehend. Recent work attempts to address those issues through either static type inference or probabilistic type prediction. Unfortunately, static type inference for dynamic languages is inherently limited, while probabilistic approaches suffer from imprecision. This paper presents TypeWriter, the first combination of probabilistic type prediction with search-based refinement of predicted types. TypeWriter‚Äôs predictor learns to infer the return and argument types for functions from partially annotated code bases by combining the natural language properties of code with programming language-level information. To validate predicted types, TypeWriter invokes a gradual type checker with different combinations of the predicted types, while navigating the space of possible type combinations in a feedback-directed manner. We implement the TypeWriter approach for Python and evaluate it on two code corpora: a multi-million line code base at Facebook and a collection of 1,137 popular open-source projects. We show that TypeWriter‚Äôs type predictor achieves an F1 score of 0.64 (0.79) in the top-1 (top-5) predictions for return types, and 0.57 (0.80) for argument types, which clearly outperforms prior type prediction models. By combining predictions with search-based validation, TypeWriter can fully annotate between 14\\% to 44\\% of the files in a randomly selected corpus, while ensuring type correctness. A comparison with a static type inference tool shows that TypeWriter adds many more non-trivial types. TypeWriter currently suggests types to developers at Facebook and several thousands of types have already been accepted with minimal changes.",

Developers are adopting forced initialization to cope with UBI bugs, but this approach can still lead to undefined behaviors (e.g., NULL pointer dereference). As it is hard to infer correct initialization values, we believe that the best way to mitigate UBI bugs is detection and manual patching. Precise detection of UBI bugs requires path-sensitive analysis. The detector needs to track an associated variable‚Äôs initialization status along all the possible program execution paths to its uses. However, such exhaustive analysis prevents the detection from scaling to the whole Linux kernel. This paper presents UBITect, a UBI bug finding tool which combines flow-sensitive type qualifier analysis and symbolic execution to perform precise and scalable UBI bug detection. The scalable qualifier analysis guides symbolic execution to analyze variables that are likely to cause UBI bugs. UBITect also does not require manual effort for annotations and hence, it can be directly applied to the kernel without any source code or intermediate representation (IR) change. On the Linux kernel version 4.14, UBITect reported 190 bugs, among which 78 bugs were deemed by us as true positives and 52 were confirmed by Linux maintainers.",

In this paper, we study the factors that influence the selection process of libraries, as perceived by industry developers. To that aim, we perform a cross-sectional interview study with 16 developers from 11 different businesses and survey 115 developers that are involved in the selection of libraries. We systematically devised a comprehensive set of 26 technical, human, and economic factors that developers take into consideration when selecting a software library. Eight of these factors are new to the literature. We explain each of these factors and how they play a role in the decision.

    "abstract": "The landscape of web APIs is evolving to meet new client requirements and to facilitate how providers fulfill them. A recent web API model is GraphQL, which is both a query language and a runtime. Using GraphQL, client queries express the data they want to retrieve or mutate, and servers respond with exactly those data or changes. GraphQL‚Äôs expressiveness is risky for service providers because clients can succinctly request stupendous amounts of data, and responding to overly complex queries can be costly or disrupt service availability. Recent empirical work has shown that many service providers are at risk. Using traditional API management methods is not sufficient, and practitioners lack principled means of estimating and measuring the cost of the GraphQL queries they receive. In this work, we present a linear-time GraphQL query analysis that can measure the cost of a query without executing it. Our approach can be applied in a separate API management layer and used with arbitrary GraphQL backends. In contrast to existing static approaches, our analysis supports common GraphQL conventions that affect query cost, and our analysis is provably correct based on our formal specification of GraphQL semantics. We demonstrate the potential of our approach using a novel GraphQL query-response corpus for two commercial GraphQL APIs. Our query analysis consistently obtains upper cost bounds, tight enough relative to the true response sizes to be actionable for service providers. In contrast, existing static GraphQL query analyses exhibit over-estimates and under-estimates because they fail to support GraphQL conventions.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent services provide the power of AI to developers via simple RESTful API endpoints, abstracting away many complexities of machine learning. However, most of these intelligent services---such as computer vision---continually learn with time. When the internals within the abstracted 'black box' become hidden and evolve, pitfalls emerge in the robustness of applications that depend on these evolving services. Without adapting the way developers plan and construct projects reliant on intelligent services, significant gaps and risks result in both project planning and development. Therefore, how can software engineers best mitigate software evolution risk moving forward, thereby ensuring that their own applications maintain quality? Our proposal is an architectural tactic designed to improve intelligent service-dependent software robustness. The tactic involves creating an application-specific benchmark dataset baselined against an intelligent service, enabling evolutionary behaviour changes to be mitigated. A technical evaluation of our implementation of this architecture demonstrates how the tactic can identify 1,054 cases of substantial confidence evolution and 2,461 cases of substantial changes to response label sets using a dataset consisting of 331 images that evolve when sent to a service.",

    "abstract": "Data stored in cloud services is highly sensitive and so access to it is controlled via policies written in domain-specific languages (DSLs). The expressiveness of these DSLs provides users flexibility to cover a wide variety of uses cases, however, unintended misconfigurations can lead to potential security issues. We introduce Block Public Access, a tool that formally verifies policies to ensure that they only allow access to trusted principals, i.e. that they prohibit access to the general public. To this end, we formalize the notion of Trust Safety that formally characterizes whether or not a policy allows unconstrained (public) access. Next, we present a method to compile the policy down to a logical formula whose unsatisfiability can be (1) checked by SMT and (2) ensures Trust Safety. The constructs of the policy DSLs render unsatisfiability checking PSPACE-complete, which precludes verifying the millions of requests per second seen at cloud scale. Hence, we present an approach that leverages the structure of the policy DSL to compute a much smaller residual policy that corresponds only to untrusted accesses. Our approach allows Block Public Access to, in the common case, syntactically verify Trust Safety without having to query the SMT solver. We have implemented Block Public Access and present an evaluation showing how the above optimization yields a low-latency policy verifier that the S3 team at AWS has integrated into their authorization system, where it is currently in production, analyzing millions of policies everyday to ensure that client buckets do not grant unintended public access.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale cloud systems, unplanned service interruptions and outages may cause severe degradation of service availability. Such incidents can occur in a bursty manner, which will deteriorate user satisfaction. Identifying incidents rapidly and accurately is critical to the operation and maintenance of a cloud system. In industrial practice, incidents are typically detected through analyzing the issue reports, which are generated over time by monitoring cloud services. Identifying incidents in a large number of issue reports is quite challenging. An issue report is typically multi-dimensional: it has many categorical attributes. It is difficult to identify a specific attribute combination that indicates an incident. Existing methods generally rely on pruning-based search, which is time-consuming given high-dimensional data, thus not practical to incident detection in large-scale cloud systems. In this paper, we propose MID (Multi-dimensional Incident Detection), a novel framework for identifying incidents from large-amount, multi-dimensional issue reports effectively and efficiently. Key to the MID design is encoding the problem into a combinatorial optimization problem. Then a specific-tailored meta-heuristic search method is designed, which can rapidly identify attribute combinations that indicate incidents. We evaluate MID with extensive experiments using both synthetic data and real-world data collected from a large-scale production cloud system. The experimental results show that MID significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, MID has been successfully applied to Microsoft's cloud systems and helped greatly reduce manual maintenance effort.",

In this work, we investigate the incidents and their links in a representative real-world incident management (IcM) system. Based on the identified indicators of linked incidents, we further propose LiDAR (Linked Incident identification with DAta-driven Representation), a deep learning based approach to incident linking.

    "abstract": "Incidents in online service systems could dramatically degrade system availability and destroy user experience. To guarantee service quality and reduce economic loss, it is essential to predict the occurrence of incidents in advance so that engineers can take some proactive actions to prevent them. In this work, we propose an effective and interpretable incident prediction approach, called eWarn, which utilizes historical data to forecast whether an incident will happen in the near future based on alert data in real time. More specifically, eWarn first extracts a set of effective features (including textual features and statistical features) to represent omen alert patterns via careful feature engineering. To reduce the influence of noisy alerts (that are not relevant to the occurrence of incidents), eWarn then incorporates the multi-instance learning formulation. Finally, eWarn builds a classification model via machine learning and generates an interpretable report about the prediction result via a state-of-the-art explanation technique (i.e., LIME). In this way, an early warning signal along with its interpretable report can be sent to engineers to facilitate their understanding and handling for the incoming incident. An extensive study on 11 real-world online service systems from a large commercial bank demonstrates the effectiveness of eWarn, outperforming state-of-the-art alert-based incident prediction approaches and the practice of incident prediction with alerts. In particular, we have applied eWarn to two large commercial banks in practice and shared some success stories and lessons learned from real deployment.",

    "abstract": "An effective and efficient application of Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD) requires software projects to follow certain principles and good practices. Configuring such a CI/CD pipeline is challenging and error-prone. Therefore, automated linters have been proposed to detect errors in the pipeline. While existing linters identify syntactic errors, detect security vulnerabilities or misuse of the features provided by build servers, they do not support developers that want to prevent common misconfigurations of a CD pipeline that potentially violate CD principles (‚ÄúCD smells‚Äù). To this end, we propose CD-Linter, a semantic linter that can automatically identify four different smells in pipeline configuration files. We have evaluated our approach through a large-scale and long-term study that consists of (i) monitoring 145 issues (opened in as many open-source projects) over a period of 6 months, (ii) manually validating the detection precision and recall on a representative sample of issues, and (iii) assessing the magnitude of the observed smells on 5,312 open-source projects on GitLab. Our results show that CD smells are accepted and fixed by most of the developers and our linter achieves a precision of 87\\% and a recall of 94\\%. Those smells can be frequently observed in the wild, as 31\\% of projects with long configurations are affected by at least one smell.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of containerization, cloud development, and continuous integration and delivery, configuration has become an essential aspect not only to tailor software to user requirements, but also to configure a software system‚Äôs environment and infrastructure. This heterogeneity of activities, domains, and processes blurs the term configuration, as it is not clear anymore what tasks, artifacts, or stakeholders are involved and intertwined. However, each re- search study and each paper involving configuration places their contributions and findings in a certain context without making the context explicit. This makes it difficult to compare findings, translate them to practice, and to generalize the results. Thus, we set out to evaluate whether these different views on configuration are really distinct or can be summarized under a common umbrella. By interviewing practitioners from different domains and in different roles about the aspects of configuration and by analyzing two qualitative studies in similar areas, we derive a model of configuration that provides terminology and context for research studies, identifies new research opportunities, and allows practitioners to spot possible challenges in their current tasks. Although our interviewees have a clear view about configuration, it substantially differs due to their personal experience and role. This indicates that the term configuration might be overloaded. However, when taking a closer look, we see the interconnections and dependencies among all views, arriving at the conclusion that we need to start considering the entire spectrum of dimensions of configuration.",

Trading quality for performance has been investigated for single application scenarios, but not for environments where multiple approximate applications may run concurrently on the same machine, interfering with each other by sharing machine resources. Applying existing, single application techniques to this multi-programming environment may lead to configuration space size explosion, or result in poor overall application quality outcomes.  Our new RAPID-M system is the first cross-application con-figuration management framework. It reduces the problem size by clustering configurations of individual applications into local\"similarity buckets\". The global cross-applications configuration selection is based on these local bucket spaces. RAPID-M dynamically assigns buckets to applications such that overall quality is maximized while respecting individual application cost budgets.Once assigned a bucket, reconfigurations within buckets may be performed locally with minimal impact on global selections. Experimental results using six configurable applications show that even large configuration spaces of complex applications can be clustered into a small number of buckets, resulting in search space size reductions of up to 9 orders of magnitude for our six applications. RAPID-M constructs performance cost models with an average prediction error of ‚â§3\\%. For our application execution traces, RAPID-M dynamically selects configurations that lower the budget violation rate by 33.9\\% with an average budget exceeding rate of 6.6\\% as compared to other possible approaches.

    "abstract": "A large percentage of real-world software configuration issues, such as misconfigurations, involve multiple interdependent configuration parameters. However, existing techniques and tools either do not consider dependencies among configuration parameters‚Äî termed configuration dependencies‚Äîor rely on one or two dependency types and code patterns as input. Without rigorous understanding of configuration dependencies, it is hard to deal with many resulting configuration issues.  This paper presents our study of software configuration dependencies in 16 widely-used cloud and datacenter systems, including dependencies within and across software components. To understand types of configuration dependencies, we conduct an exhaustive search of descriptions in structured configuration metadata and unstructured user manuals. We find and manually analyze 521 configuration dependencies. We define five types of configuration dependencies and identify their common code patterns. We report on consequences of not satisfying these dependencies and current software engineering practices for handling the consequences.  We mechanize the knowledge gained from our study in a tool, cDep, which detects configuration dependencies. cDep automatically discovers five types of configuration dependencies from bytecode using static program analysis. We apply cDep to the eight Java and Scala software systems in our study. cDep finds 87.9\\% (275/313) of the related subset of dependencies from our study. cDep also finds 448 previously undocumented dependencies, with a 6.0\\% average false positive rate.

    "abstract": "The typical software tutorial includes step-by-step instructions for installing developer tools, editing files and code, and running commands. When these software tutorials are not executable, either due to missing instructions, ambiguous steps, or simply broken commands, their value is diminished. Non-executable tutorials impact developers in several ways, including frustrating learning experiences, and limiting usability of developer tools.  To understand to what extent software tutorials are executable---and why they may fail---we conduct an empirical study on over 600 tutorials, including nearly 15,000 code blocks. We find a naive execution strategy achieves an overall executability rate of only 26\\%. Even a human-annotation-based execution strategy---while doubling executability---still yields no tutorial that can successfully execute all steps. We identify several common executability barriers, ranging from potentially innocuous causes, such as interactive prompts requiring human responses, to insidious errors, such as missing steps and inaccessible resources. We validate our findings with major stakeholders in technical documentation and discuss possible strategies for improving software tutorials, such as providing accessible alternatives for tutorial takers, and investing in automated tutorial testing to ensure continuous quality of software tutorials.",

    "abstract": "Good documentation offers the promise of enabling developers to easily understand design decisions. Unfortunately, in practice, design documents are often rarely updated, becoming inaccurate, incomplete, and untrustworthy. A better solution is to enable developers to write down design rules which are checked against code for consistency. But existing rule checkers require learning specialized query languages or program analysis frameworks, creating a barrier to writing project-specific rules. We introduce two new techniques for authoring design rules: snippet-based authoring and semi-natural-language authoring. In snippet-based authoring, developers specify characteristics of elements to match by writing partial code snippets. In semi-natural language authoring, a textual representation offers a representation for understanding design rules and resolving ambiguities. We implemented these approaches in RulePad. To evaluate RulePad, we conducted a between-subjects study with 14 participants comparing RulePad to the PMD Designer, a utility for writing rules in a popular rule checker. We found that those with RulePad were able to successfully author 13 times more query elements in significantly less time and reported being significantly more willing to use RulePad in their everyday work.",

    "abstract": "Keeping a good influx of newcomers is critical for open source software projects' survival, while newcomers face many barriers to contributing to a project for the first time. To support newcomers onboarding, GitHub encourages projects to apply labels such as good first issue (GFI) to tag issues suitable for newcomers. However, many newcomers still fail to contribute even after many attempts, which not only reduces the enthusiasm of newcomers to contribute but makes the efforts of project members in vain. To better support the onboarding of newcomers, this paper reports a preliminary study on this mechanism from its application status, effect, problems, and best practices. By analyzing 9,368 GFIs from 816 popular GitHub projects and conducting email surveys with newcomers and project members, we obtain the following results. We find that more and more projects are applying this mechanism in the past decade, especially the popular projects. Compared to common issues, GFIs usually need more days to be solved. While some newcomers really join the projects through GFIs, almost half of GFIs are not solved by newcomers. We also discover a series of problems covering mechanism (e.g., inappropriate GFIs), project (e.g., insufficient GFIs) and newcomer (e.g., uneven skills) that makes this mechanism ineffective. We discover the practices that may address the problems, including identifying GFIs that have informative description and available support, and require limited scope and skill, etc. Newcomer onboarding is an important but challenging question in open source projects and our work enables a better understanding of GFI mechanism and its problems, as well as highlights ways in improving them.",

In this paper, we study the well-established Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and devise an integrated engagement theory grounded in multiple data sources to explain motivation and onboarding in this context. Our analysis shows that OSS communities employ several strategies for planning and executing student participation, socially integrating the students, and rewarding student‚Äôs contributions and achievements. Students are motivated by a blend of rewards, which are moderated by external factors. We presented these rewards and the motivation theory to students who had never participated in a summer of code program and collected their shift in motivation after learning about the theory.

    "abstract": "Software reuse lowers development costs and improves the quality of software systems. Two strategies are common: clone \\& own (copying and adapting a system) and platform-oriented reuse (building a configurable platform). The former is readily available, flexible, and initially cheap, but does not scale with the frequency of reuse, imposing high maintenance costs. The latter scales, but imposes high upfront investments for building the platform, and reduces flexibility. As such, each strategy has distinctive advantages and disadvantages, imposing different development activities and software architectures. Deciding for one strategy is a core decision with long-term impact on an organization‚Äôs software development. Unfortunately, the strategies‚Äô costs are not well-understood - not surprisingly, given the lack of systematically elicited empirical data, which is difficult to collect. We present an empirical study of the development activities, costs, cost factors, and benefits associated with either reuse strategy. For this purpose, we combine quantitative and qualitative data that we triangulated from 26 interviews at a large organization and a systematic literature review covering 57 publications. Our study both confirms and refutes common hypotheses on software reuse. For instance, we confirm that developing for platform-oriented reuse is more expensive, but simultaneously reduces reuse costs; and that platform-orientation results in higher code quality compared to clone \\& own. Surprisingly, refuting common hypotheses, we find that change propagation can be more expensive in a platform, that platforms can facilitate the advancement into innovative markets, and that there is no strict distinction of clone \\& own and platform-oriented reuse in practice.",

While technical interviews should allow for an unbiased and inclusive assessment of problem-solving ability, surprisingly, technical interviews may be instead a procedure for identifying candidates who best handle and migrate stress solely caused by being examined by an interviewer (performance anxiety). To understand if coding interviews‚Äîas administered today‚Äîcan induce stress that significantly hinders performance, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 48 Computer Science students, comparing them in private and public whiteboard settings. We found that performance is reduced by more than half, by simply being watched by an interviewer. We also observed that stress and cognitive load were significantly higher in a traditional technical interview when compared with our private interview. Consequently, interviewers may be filtering out qualified candidates by confounding assessment of problem-solving ability with unnecessary stress. We propose interview modifications to make problem-solving assessment more equitable and inclusive, such as through private focus sessions and retrospective think-aloud, allowing companies to hire from a larger and diverse pool of talent.",

    "abstract": "When software products and services are developed and maintained over longer time, software engineering practices tend to drift away from both structured and agile methods. Nonetheless, in many cases the evolving practices are far from ad hoc or chaotic. How are the teams involved able to coordinate their joint development?This article reports on an ethnographic study of a small team at a successful provider of software as a service. What struck us was the very explicit way in which the team adopted and adapted their practices to fit the needs of the evolving development. The discussion relates the findings to the concepts of social practices and methods in software engineering, and explores the differences between degraded behavior and the coordinated evolution of development practices. The analysis helps to better understand how software engineering practices evolve, and thus provides a starting point for rethinking software engineering methods and their relation to software engineering practice.",

In this paper, we rely on a recent innovation in transparency on code hosting platforms like GitHub---the use of repository badges---to track how automation tools spread in open-source ecosystems through different social and technical mechanisms over time. Using a large longitudinal data set, multivariate network science techniques, and survival analysis, we study which socio-technical factors can best explain the observed diffusion process of a number of popular automation tools. Our results show that factors such as social exposure, competition, and observability affect the adoption of tools significantly, and they provide a roadmap for software engineers and researchers seeking to propagate best practices and tools.",

    "abstract": "As a mixed result of intensive dependency on third-party libraries, flexible mechanisms to declare dependencies and increased number of modules in a project, different modules of a project directly depend on multiple versions of the same third-party library. Such library version inconsistencies could increase dependency maintenance cost, or even lead to dependency conflicts when modules are inter-dependent. Although automated build tools (e.g., Maven's enforcer plugin) provide partial support to detect library version inconsistencies, they do not provide any support to harmonize inconsistent library versions.  We first conduct a survey with 131 Java developers from GitHub to retrieve first-hand information about the root causes, detection methods, reasons for fixing or not fixing, fixing strategies, fixing efforts, and tool expectations on library version inconsistencies. Then, based on the insights from our survey, we propose LibHarmo, an interactive, effort-aware library version harmonization technique, to detect library version inconsistencies, interactively suggest a harmonized version with the least harmonization efforts based on library API usage analysis, and refactor build configuration files.  LibHarmo is currently developed for Java Maven projects. Our experimental study on 443 highly-starred Java Maven projects from GitHub shows that i) LibHarmo detected 621 library version inconsistencies in 152 (34.3\\%) projects with a false positive rate of 16.8\\%, while Maven's enforcer plugin only detected 219 of them; and ii) LibHarmo saved 87.5\\% of the harmonization efforts. Further, 31 library version inconsistencies have been confirmed, and 17 of them have been already harmonized by developers.",

Despite a large body of work on MSR, researchers have focused almost exclusively on repositories that contain code written in imperative programming languages, such as Java and C/C++. Unlike prior work, in this paper, we focus on mining publicly available hardware descriptions (HDs) written in hardware description languages (HDLs), such as VHDL. HDLs have unique syntax and semantics compared to popular imperative languages, and learning-based tools available to hardware designers are well behind those used in other application domains. We assembled large HD corpora consisting of source code written in several HDLs and report on their characteristics. Our language model evaluation reveals that HDs possess a high level of naturalness similar to software written in imperative languages. Further, by utilizing our corpora, we built several deep learning models for automated code completion in VHDL; our models take into account unique characteristics of HDLs, including similarities of nearby concurrent signal assignment statements, in-built concurrency, and the frequently used signal types. These characteristics led to more effective neural models, achieving a BLEU score of 37.3, an 8-14-point improvement over rule-based and neural baselines.",

Fast forward to five years, no further studies investigated whether the questions from the software engineers at Microsoft hold for other software companies, including software-intensive companies with different primary focus (to which we refer as software-defined enterprises). Furthermore, it is not evident that the problems identified five years ago are still applicable, given the technological advances in software engineering. This paper presents a study at ING, a software-defined enterprise in banking in which over 15,000 IT staff provides in-house software solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive guide of questions for data scientists selected from the previous study at Microsoft along with our current work at ING. We replicated the original Microsoft study at ING, looking for questions that impact both software companies and software-defined enterprises and continue to impact software engineering. We also add new questions that emerged from differences in the context of the two companies and the five years gap in between. Our results show that software engineering questions for data scientists in the software-defined enterprise are largely similar to the software company, albeit with exceptions. We hope that the software engineering research community builds on the new list of questions to create a useful body of knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The software development profession suffers from severe gender biases, which could be explicit and implicit. However, SE literature has not systematically explored and evaluated the methods for reducing gender biases, especially for implicit gender biases. This paper reports on a field experiment to examine whether the intergroup contact theory could reduce implicit gender biases in software development. In the field experiment, 280 undergraduate students taking a project-centric introductory software engineering course were assigned to 70 teams with different contact configurations. We measured and compared their explicit and implicit gender biases before and after contacts in their teams. The study yields a rich set of findings. First, we confirmed the positive effects of intergroup contact theory in reducing gender biases, particularly the implicit gender biases in both general and SE-specific contexts. We further revealed that such effects were subjected to different contact configurations. The intergroup contact theory's effects were maximized in teams where the number of females is greater than or equal to the number of males. When the female is the minority group in a team, contacts among members contribute to reducing male members' implicit gender biases but fail to result in the same scale of effects on female members' implicit gender biases. The findings provide insights into using intergroup contact theory in reducing implicit gender biases in software development contexts.",

Previous research focused on defining and quantifying this phenomenon, but not on explaining or critiquing it. In this work, we address core omissions to the body of work on atoms of confusion, focusing on the ‚Äòhow‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy‚Äô of programmer misunderstanding. We performed a think-aloud study in which we observed programmers, both professionals and students, as they hand-evaluated confusing code. We performed a qualitative analysis of the data and found several surprising results, which explain previous results, outline avenues of further research, and suggest improvements of the research methodology. A notable observation is that correct hand-evaluations do not imply understanding, and incorrect evaluations not misunderstanding. We believe this and other observations may be used to improve future studies and models of program comprehension. We argue that thinking of confusion as an atomic construct may pose challenges to formulating new candidates for atoms of confusion. Ultimately, we question whether hand-evaluation correctness is, itself, a sufficient instrument to study program comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Build systems are essential for modern software maintenance and development, while build failures occur frequently across software systems, inducing non-negligible costs in development activities. Build failure resolution is a challenging problem and multiple studies have demonstrated that developers spend non-trivial time in resolving encountered build failures; to relieve manual efforts, automated resolution techniques are emerging recently, which are promising but still limitedly effective. Understanding how build failures are resolved in practice can provide guidelines for both developers and researchers on build issue resolution. Therefore, this work presents a comprehensive study of fix patterns in practical build failures. Specifically, we study 1,080 build issues of three popular build systems Maven, Ant, and Gradle from Stack Overflow, construct a fine-granularity taxonomy of 50 categories regarding to the failure symptoms, and summarize the fix patterns for different failure types. Our key findings reveal that build issues stretch over a wide spectrum of symptoms; 67.96\\% of the build issues are fixed by modifying the build script code related to plugins and dependencies; and there are 20 symptom categories, more than half of whose build issues can be fixed by specific patterns. Furthermore, we also address the challenges in applying non-intuitive or simplistic fix patterns for developers.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly being used in important decision-making software such as approving bank loans, recommending criminal sentencing, hiring employees, and so on. It is important to ensure the fairness of these models so that no discrimination is made based on protected attribute (e.g., race, sex, age) while decision making. Algorithms have been developed to measure unfairness and mitigate them to a certain extent. In this paper, we have focused on the empirical evaluation of fairness and mitigations on real-world machine learning models. We have created a benchmark of 40 top-rated models from Kaggle used for 5 different tasks, and then using a comprehensive set of fairness metrics, evaluated their fairness. Then, we have applied 7 mitigation techniques on these models and analyzed the fairness, mitigation results, and impacts on performance. We have found that some model optimization techniques result in inducing unfairness in the models. On the other hand, although there are some fairness control mechanisms in machine learning libraries, they are not documented. The mitigation algorithm also exhibit common patterns such as mitigation in the post-processing is often costly (in terms of performance) and mitigation in the pre-processing stage is preferred in most cases. We have also presented different trade-off choices of fairness mitigation decisions. Our study suggests future research directions to reduce the gap between theoretical fairness aware algorithms and the software engineering methods to leverage them in practice.",

But sometimes, the core part of this software (the learned model), behaves in a biased manner that gives undue advantages to a specific group of people (where those groups are determined by sex, race, etc.). This \"algorithmic discrimination\" in the AI software systems has become a matter of serious concern in the machine learning and software engineering community. There have been works done to find \"algorithmic bias\" or \"ethical bias\" in the software system. Once the bias is detected in the AI software system, the mitigation of bias is extremely important. In this work, we a)explain how ground-truth bias in training data affects machine learning model fairness and how to find that bias in AI software,b)propose a method Fairway which combines pre-processing and in-processing approach to remove ethical bias from training data and trained model. Our results show that we can find bias and mitigate bias in a learned model, without much damaging the predictive performance of that model. We propose that (1) testing for bias and (2) bias mitigation should be a routine part of the machine learning software development life cycle. Fairway offers much support for these two purposes.",

Without clear understanding of the game rules, participants may suffer from fraudulent advertisements and financial losses. In this paper, we present a framework to perform (semi-)automated verification of smart contract fairness, whose results can be used to refute false claims with concrete examples or certify contract implementations with respect to desired fairness properties. We implement FairCon, which is able to check fairness properties including truthfulness, efficiency, optimality, and collusion-freeness for Ethereum smart contracts.

    "author": "B\\\"{o}hme, Marcel and Man\\`{e}s, Valentin J. M. and Cha, Sang Kil",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we take the fundamental perspective of fuzzing as a learning process. Suppose before fuzzing, we know nothing about the behaviors of a program P: What does it do? Executing the first test input, we learn how P behaves for this input. Executing the next input, we either observe the same or discover a new behavior. As such, each execution reveals ‚Äùsome amount‚Äù of information about P‚Äôs behaviors. A classic measure of information is Shannon‚Äôs entropy. Measuring entropy allows us to quantify how much is learned from each generated test input about the behaviors of the program. Within a probabilistic model of fuzzing, we show how entropy also measures fuzzer efficiency. Specifically, it measures the general rate at which the fuzzer discovers new behaviors. Intuitively, efficient fuzzers maximize information. From this information theoretic perspective, we develop Entropic, an entropy-based power schedule for greybox fuzzing which assigns more energy to seeds that maximize information. We implemented Entropic into the popular greybox fuzzer LibFuzzer. Our experiments with more than 250 open-source programs (60 million LoC) demonstrate a substantially improved efficiency and confirm our hypothesis that an efficient fuzzer maximizes information. Entropic has been independently evaluated and invited for integration into main-line LibFuzzer. Entropic now runs on more than 25,000 machines fuzzing hundreds of security-critical software systems simultaneously and continuously.",

Empowered its randomness nature along with a coverage-guiding feature, fuzzing has been identified a vast number of vulnerabilities in real-world programs. This paper begins with an observation that the design of the current state-of-the-art fuzzers is not well suited for a particular (but yet important) set of software programs. Specifically, current fuzzers have limitations in fuzzing programs serving multiple purposes, where each purpose is controlled by extra options.  This paper proposes CrFuzz, which overcomes this limitation. CrFuzz designs a clustering analysis to automatically predict if a newly given input would be accepted or not by a target program. Exploiting this prediction capability, CrFuzz is designed to efficiently explore the programs with multiple purposes. We employed CrFuzz for three state-of-the-art fuzzers, AFL, QSYM, and MOpt, and CrFuzz-augmented versions have shown 19.3\\% and 5.68\\% better path and edge coverage on average. More importantly, during two weeks of long-running experiments, CrFuzz discovered 277 previously unknown vulnerabilities where 212 of those are already confirmed and fixed by the respected vendors. We would like to emphasize that many of these vulnerabilities were discoverd from FFMpeg, ImageMagick, and Graphicsmagick, all of which are targets of Google's OSS-Fuzz project and thus heavily fuzzed for last three years by far. Nevertheless, CrFuzz identified a remarkable number of vulnerabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness of vulnerability finding capability.",

For instance, with twice the machines, we can find all known bugs in half the time. Yet, finding linearly more bugs in the same time requires exponentially more machines. For instance, for every new bug we want to find in 24 hours, we might need twice more machines. Similarly for coverage. With exponentially more machines, we can cover the same code exponentially faster, but uncovered code only linearly faster. In other words, re-discovering the same vulnerabilities is cheap but finding new vulnerabilities is expensive. This holds even under the simplifying assumption of no parallelization overhead. We derive these observations from over four CPU years worth of fuzzing campaigns involving almost three hundred open source programs, two state-of-the-art greybox fuzzers, four measures of code coverage, and two measures of vulnerability discovery.

In this paper, we study how to intelligently generate data payloads embedded in REST API requests in order to find data-processing bugs in cloud services.

We then propose and evaluate a range of data fuzzing techniques, including structural schema fuzzing rules, various rule combinations, search heuristics, extracting data values from examples included in REST API specifications, and learning data values on-the-fly from previous service responses.

    "author": "She, Dongdong and Krishna, Rahul and Yan, Lu and Jana, Suman and Ray, Baishakhi",
    "abstract": "Fuzzing is a widely used technique for detecting software bugs and vulnerabilities. Most popular fuzzers generate new inputs using an evolutionary search to maximize code coverage. Essentially, these fuzzers start with a set of seed inputs, mutate them to generate new inputs, and identify the promising inputs using an evolutionary fitness function for further mutation.Despite their success, evolutionary fuzzers tend to get stuck in long sequences of unproductive mutations. In recent years, machine learning (ML) based mutation strategies have reported promising results. However, the existing ML-based fuzzers are limited by the lack of quality and diversity of the training data. As the input space of the target programs is high dimensional and sparse, it is prohibitively expensive to collect many diverse samples demonstrating successful and unsuccessful mutations to train the model.In this paper, we address these issues by using a Multi-Task Neural Network that can learn a compact embedding of the input space based on diverse training samples for multiple related tasks (i.e.,predicting for different types of coverage). The compact embedding can guide the mutation process by focusing most of the mutations on the parts of the embedding where the gradient is high. MTFuzz uncovers 11 previously unseen bugs and achieves an average of 2\\texttimes{} more edge coverage compared with 5 state-of-the-art fuzzer on 10 real-world programs",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) becomes increasingly pervasive, being used in a wide range of software applications. These software applications, named as DL based software (in short as DL software), integrate DL models trained using a large data corpus with DL programs written based on DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. A DL program encodes the network structure of a desirable DL model and the process by which the model is trained using the training data. To help developers of DL software meet the new challenges posed by DL, enormous research efforts in software engineering have been devoted. Existing studies focus on the development of DL software and extensively analyze faults in DL programs. However, the deployment of DL software has not been comprehensively studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study on understanding challenges in deploying DL software. We mine and analyze 3,023 relevant posts from Stack Overflow, a popular Q&A website for developers, and show the increasing popularity and high difficulty of DL software deployment among developers. We build a taxonomy of specific challenges encountered by developers in the process of DL software deployment through manual inspection of 769 sampled posts and report a series of actionable implications for researchers, developers, and DL framework vendors.",

    "abstract": "We consider a usage model for automated machine learning (AutoML) in which users can influence the generated pipeline by providing a weak pipeline specification: an unordered set of API components from which the AutoML system draws the components it places into the generated pipeline. Such specifications allow users to express preferences over the components that appear in the pipeline, for example a desire for interpretable components to appear in the pipeline. We present AMS, an approach to automatically strengthen weak specifications to include unspecified complementary and functionally related API components, populate the space of hyperparameters and their values, and pair this configuration with a search procedure to produce a strong pipeline specification: a full description of the search space for candidate pipelines. ams uses normalized pointwise mutual information on a code corpus to identify complementary components, BM25 as a lexical similarity score over the target API's documentation to identify functionally related components, and frequency distributions in the code corpus to extract key hyperparameters and values. We show that strengthened specifications can produce pipelines that outperform the pipelines generated from the initial weak specification and an expert-annotated variant, while producing pipelines that still reflect the user preferences captured in the original weak specification.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) techniques are rapidly developed and have been widely adopted in practice. However, similar to traditional software systems, DL systems also contain bugs, which could cause serious impacts especially in safety-critical domains. Recently, many research approaches have focused on testing DL models, while little attention has been paid for testing DL libraries, which is the basis of building DL models and directly affects the behavior of DL systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach, LEMON, to testing DL libraries. In particular, we (1) design a series of mutation rules for DL models, with the purpose of exploring different invoking sequences of library code and hard-to-trigger behaviors; and (2) propose a heuristic strategy to guide the model generation process towards the direction of amplifying the inconsistent degrees of the inconsistencies between different DL libraries caused by bugs, so as to mitigate the impact of potential noise introduced by uncertain factors in DL libraries. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of LEMON with 20 release versions of 4 widely-used DL libraries, i.e., TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, MXNet. The results demonstrate that LEMON detected 24 new bugs in the latest release versions of these libraries, where 7 bugs have been confirmed and one bug has been fixed by developers. Besides, the results confirm that the heuristic strategy for model generation indeed effectively guides LEMON in amplifying the inconsistent degrees for bugs.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in the software development process to automatically learn patterns from massive data. However, many applications still make decisions based on rules that are manually crafted and verified by domain experts due to safety or security concerns. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between DNNs and rule-based systems by automating the rule generation process via extracting knowledge from well-trained DNNs. Existing techniques with similar purposes either rely on specific DNNs input instances or use inherently unstable random sampling of the input space. Therefore, these approaches either limit the exploration area to a local decision-space of the DNNs or fail to converge to a consistent set of rules. The resulting rules thus lack representativeness and stability.  In this paper, we address the two aforementioned shortcomings by discovering a global property of the DNNs and use it to remodel the DNNs decision-boundary. We name this property as the activation probability, and show that this property is stable. With this insight, we propose an approach named DENAS including a novel rule-generation algorithm. Our proposed algorithm approximates the non-linear decision boundary of DNNs by iteratively superimposing a linearized optimization function.  We evaluate the representativeness, stability, and accuracy of DENAS against five state-of-the-art techniques (LEMNA, Gradient, IG, DeepTaylor, and DTExtract) on three software engineering and security applications: Binary analysis, PDF malware detection, and Android malware detection. Our results show that DENAS can generate more representative rules consistently in a more stable manner over other approaches. We further offer case studies that demonstrate the applications of DENAS such as debugging faults in the DNNs and generating signatures that can detect zero-day malware.",

    "abstract": "Detecting bugs in deep learning software at the architecture level provides additional benefits that detecting bugs at the model level does not provide. This paper makes the first attempt to conduct static analysis for detecting numerical bugs at the architecture level. We propose a static analysis approach for detecting numerical bugs in neural architectures based on abstract interpretation. Our approach mainly comprises two kinds of abstraction techniques, i.e., one for tensors and one for numerical values. Moreover, to scale up while maintaining adequate detection precision, we propose two abstraction techniques: tensor partitioning and (elementwise) affine relation analysis to abstract tensors and numerical values, respectively. We realize the combination scheme of tensor partitioning and affine relation analysis (together with interval analysis) as DEBAR, and evaluate it on two datasets: neural architectures with known bugs (collected from existing studies) and real-world neural architectures. The evaluation results show that DEBAR outperforms other tensor and numerical abstraction techniques on accuracy without losing scalability. DEBAR successfully detects all known numerical bugs with no false positives within 1.7‚Äì2.3 seconds per architecture. On the real-world architectures, DEBAR reports 529 warnings within 2.6‚Äì135.4 seconds per architecture, where 299 warnings are true positives.",

In this paper, we introduce NNSlicer, the first approach for slicing deep neural networks based on data-flow analysis. Our method understands the reaction of each neuron to an input based on the difference between its behavior activated by the input and the average behavior over the whole dataset. Then we quantify the neuron contributions to the slicing criterion by recursively backtracking from the output neurons, and calculate the slice as the neurons and the synapses with larger contributions. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of NNSlicer with three applications, including adversarial input detection, model pruning, and selective model protection. In all applications, NNSlicer significantly outperforms other baselines that do not rely on data flow analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recent effort to test deep learning systems has produced an intuitive and compelling test criterion called neuron coverage (NC), which resembles the notion of traditional code coverage. NC measures the proportion of neurons activated in a neural network and it is implicitly assumed that increasing NC improves the quality of a test suite. In an attempt to automatically generate a test suite that increases NC, we design a novel diversity promoting regularizer that can be plugged into existing adversarial attack algorithms. We then assess whether such attempts to increase NC could generate a test suite that (1) detects adversarial attacks successfully, (2) produces natural inputs, and (3) is unbiased to particular class predictions. Contrary to expectation, our extensive evaluation finds that increasing NC actually makes it harder to generate an effective test suite: higher neuron coverage leads to fewer defects detected, less natural inputs, and more biased prediction preferences. Our results invoke skepticism that increasing neuron coverage may not be a meaningful objective for generating tests for deep neural networks and call for a new test generation technique that considers defect detection, naturalness, and output impartiality in tandem.",

    "abstract": "Machine translation software has become heavily integrated into our daily lives due to the recent improvement in the performance of deep neural networks. However, machine translation software has been shown to regularly return erroneous translations, which can lead to harmful consequences such as economic loss and political conflicts. Additionally, due to the complexity of the underlying neural models, testing machine translation systems presents new challenges. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translation. Under this general idea, we provide two realizations of PatInv that given an arbitrary sentence, generate syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by: (1) replacing one word in the sentence using a masked language model or (2) removing one word or phrase from the sentence based on its constituency structure. We then test whether the returned translations are the same for the original and modified sentences. We have applied PatInv to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator using 200 English sentences. Two language settings are considered: English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Chinese (En-Zh). The results show that PatInv can accurately find 308 erroneous translations in Google Translate and 223 erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator, most of which cannot be found by the state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "author": "Riccio, Vincenzo and Tonella, Paolo",
    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of Deep Learning (DL) for critical tasks, such as autonomous driving, the evaluation of the quality of systems that rely on DL has become crucial. Once trained, DL systems produce an output for any arbitrary numeric vector provided as input, regardless of whether it is within or outside the validity domain of the system under test. Hence, the quality of such systems is determined by the intersection between their validity domain and the regions where their outputs exhibit a misbehaviour.  In this paper, we introduce the notion of frontier of behaviours, i.e., the inputs at which the DL system starts to misbehave. If the frontier of misbehaviours is outside the validity domain of the system, the quality check is passed. Otherwise, the inputs at the intersection represent quality deficiencies of the system. We developed DeepJanus, a search-based tool that generates frontier inputs for DL systems. The experimental results obtained for the lane keeping component of a self-driving car show that the frontier of a well trained system contains almost exclusively unrealistic roads that violate the best practices of civil engineering, while the frontier of a poorly trained one includes many valid inputs that point to serious deficiencies of the system.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is being incorporated in many modern software systems. Deep learning approaches train a deep neural network (DNN) model using training examples, and then use the DNN model for prediction. While the structure of a DNN model as layers is observable, the model is treated in its entirety as a monolithic component. To change the logic implemented by the model, e.g. to add/remove logic that recognizes inputs belonging to a certain class, or to replace the logic with an alternative, the training examples need to be changed and the DNN needs to be retrained using the new set of examples. We argue that decomposing a DNN into DNN modules‚Äî akin to decomposing a monolithic software code into modules‚Äîcan bring the benefits of modularity to deep learning. In this work, we develop a methodology for decomposing DNNs for multi-class problems into DNN modules. For four canonical problems, namely MNIST, EMNIST, FMNIST, and KMNIST, we demonstrate that such decomposition enables reuse of DNN modules to create different DNNs, enables replacement of one DNN module in a DNN with another without needing to retrain. The DNN models formed by composing DNN modules are at least as good as traditional monolithic DNNs in terms of test accuracy for our problems.",

    "abstract": "Trained DNN models are increasingly adopted as integral parts of software systems, but they often perform deficiently in the field. A particularly damaging problem is that DNN models often give false predictions with high confidence, due to the unavoidable slight divergences between operation data and training data. To minimize the loss caused by inaccurate confidence, operational calibration, i.e., calibrating the confidence function of a DNN classifier against its operation domain, becomes a necessary debugging step in the engineering of the whole system.  Operational calibration is difficult considering the limited budget of labeling operation data and the weak interpretability of DNN models. We propose a Bayesian approach to operational calibration that gradually corrects the confidence given by the model under calibration with a small number of labeled operation data deliberately selected from a larger set of unlabeled operation data. The approach is made effective and efficient by leveraging the locality of the learned representation of the DNN model and modeling the calibration as Gaussian Process Regression. Comprehensive experiments with various practical datasets and DNN models show that it significantly outperformed alternative methods, and in some difficult tasks it eliminated about 71\\% to 97\\% high-confidence (>0.9) errors with only about 10\\% of the minimal amount of labeled operation data needed for practical learning techniques to barely work",

However, we find that the app link is not as secure as claimed, because the verification process can be bypassed by exploiting instant apps. In this paper, we explore the weakness of the existing app link mechanism and propose three feasible hijacking attacks. Our findings show that even popular apps are subject to these attacks, such as Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook Message. Our observation is confirmed by Google. To measure the severity of these vulnerabilities, we develop an automatic tool to detect vulnerable apps, and perform a large-scale empirical study on 400,000 Android apps. Experiment results suggest that app link hijacking vulnerabilities are prevalent in the ecosystem. Specifically, 27.1\\% apps are vulnerable to link hijacking with smart text selection (STS); 30.0\\% apps are vulnerable to link hijacking without STS, and all instant apps are vulnerable to instant app attack. We provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms behind these types of attacks. Furthermore, we propose the corresponding detection and defense methods that can successfully prevent the proposed hijackings for all the evaluated apps, thus raising the bar against the attacks on Android app links. Our insights and findings demonstrate the urgency to identify and prevent app link hijacking attacks.",

Indeed, energy testing is a fledgling area of research and recent advances have mainly focused on test input generation. This paper presents ACETON, the first approach aimed at solving the oracle problem for testing the energy behavior of mobile apps. ACETON employs Deep Learning to automatically construct an oracle that not only determines whether a test execution reveals an energy defect, but also the type of energy defect. By carefully selecting features that can be monitored on any app and mobile device, we are assured the oracle constructed using ACETON is highly reusable.

This paper exposes the general workflow for this mechanism, which beyond ICCs, enables app developers to access and invoke functionalities (either entire Java classes, methods or object fields) implemented in other apps using official Android APIs. We experimentally showcase how this reuse mechanism can be leveraged to ‚Äúplagiarize\" supposedly-protected functionalities. Typically, we were able to leverage this mechanism to bypass security guards that a popular video broadcaster has placed for preventing access to its video database from outside its provided app. We further contribute with a static analysis toolkit, named DICIDer, for detecting direct inter-app code invocations in apps. An empirical analysis of the usage prevalence of this reuse mechanism is then conducted. Finally, we discuss the usage contexts as well as the implications of this studied reuse mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Facing the limited resource of smartphones, asynchronous programming significantly improves the performance of Android applications. Android provides several packaged components to ease the development of asynchronous programming. Among them, the AsyncTask component is widely used by developers since it is easy to implement. However, the abuse of AsyncTask component can decrease responsiveness and even lead to crashes. By investigating the Android Developer Documentation and technical forums, we summarize five misuse patterns about AsyncTask. To detect them, we propose a flow, context, object and field-sensitive inter-procedural static analysis approach. Specifically, the static analysis includes typestate analysis, reference analysis and loop analysis. Based on the AsyncTask-related information obtained during static analysis, we check the misuse according to predefined detection rules. The proposed approach is implemented into a tool called AsyncChecker. We evaluate AsyncChecker on a self-designed benchmark suite called AsyncBench and 1,759 real-world apps. AsyncChecker finds 17,946 misused AsyncTask instances in 1,417 real-world apps (80.6\\%). The precision, recall and F-measure of AsyncChecker on real-world applications are 97.2\\%, 89.8\\% and 0.93, respectively. Compared with existing tools, AsyncChecker can detect more asynchronous problems. We report the misuse problems to developers via GitHub.

    "abstract": "Energy accounting is a fundamental problem in energy management, defined as attributing global energy consumption to individual components of interest. In this paper, we take on this problem at the application level, where the components for accounting are application logical units, such as methods, classes, and packages. Given a Java application, our novel runtime system Chappie produces an energy footprint, i.e., the relative energy consumption of all programming abstraction units within the application.  The design of Chappie is unique in several dimensions. First, relative to targeted energy profiling where the profiler determines the energy consumption of a pre-defined application logical unit, e.g., a specific method, Chappie is total: the energy footprint encompasses all methods within an application. Second, Chappie is concurrency-aware: energy attribution is fully aware of the multi-threaded behavior of Java applications, including JVM bookkeeping threads. Third, Chappie is an embodiment of a novel philosophy for application-level energy accounting and profiling, which states that the accounting run should preserve the temporal phased power behavior of the application, and the spatial power distribution among the underlying hardware system. We term this important property as calmness. Against state-of-the-art DaCapo benchmarks, we show that the energy footprint generated by Chappie is precise while incurring negligible overhead. In addition, all results are produced with a high degree of calmness.",

    "author": "Laaber, Christoph and W\\\"{u}rsten, Stefan and Gall, Harald C. and Leitner, Philipp",
    "abstract": "Executing software microbenchmarks, a form of small-scale performance tests predominantly used for libraries and frameworks, is a costly endeavor. Full benchmark suites take up to multiple hours or days to execute, rendering frequent checks, e.g., as part of continuous integration (CI), infeasible. However, altering benchmark configurations to reduce execution time without considering the impact on result quality can lead to benchmark results that are not representative of the software‚Äôs true performance. We propose the first technique to dynamically stop software microbenchmark executions when their results are sufficiently stable. Our approach implements three statistical stoppage criteria and is capable of reducing Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) suite execution times by 48.4\\% to 86.0\\%. At the same time it retains the same result quality for 78.8\\% to 87.6\\% of the benchmarks, compared to executing the suite for the default duration. The proposed approach does not require developers to manually craft custom benchmark configurations; instead, it provides automated mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration. Hence, making dynamic reconfiguration highly effective and efficient, potentially paving the way to inclusion of JMH microbenchmarks in CI.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of testing the performance of the adaptation layer in a self-adaptive system. The problem is notoriously hard, due to the high degree of uncertainty and variability inherent in an adaptive software application. In particular, providing any type of formal guarantee for this problem is extremely difficult. In this paper we propose the use of a rigorous probabilistic approach to overcome the mentioned difficulties and provide probabilistic guarantees on the software performance. We describe the set up needed for the application of a probabilistic approach. We then discuss the traditional tools from statistics that could be applied to analyse the results, highlighting their limitations and motivating why they are unsuitable for the given problem. We propose the use of a novel tool ‚Äì the scenario theory ‚Äì to overcome said limitations. We conclude the paper with a thorough empirical evaluation of the proposed approach, using two adaptive software applications: the Tele-Assistance Service and the Self-Adaptive Video Encoder. With the first, we empirically expose the trade-off between data collection and confidence in the testing campaign. With the second, we demonstrate how to compare different adaptation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Due to the lexical gap between functionality descriptions and user queries, documentation-based API retrieval often produces poor results.Verb phrases and their phrase patterns are essential in both describing API functionalities and interpreting user queries. Thus we hypothesize that API retrieval can be facilitated by explicitly recognizing and matching between the fine-grained structures of functionality descriptions and user queries. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the functionality descriptions of 14,733 JDK and Android API methods. We identified 356 different functionality verbs from the descriptions, which were grouped into 87 functionality categories, and we extracted 523 phrase patterns from the verb phrases of the descriptions. Building on these findings, we propose an API method recommendation approach based on explicit matching of functionality verb phrases in functionality descriptions and user queries, called PreMA. Our evaluation shows that PreMA can accurately recognize the functionality categories (92.8\\%) and phrase patterns (90.4\\%) of functionality description sentences; and when used for API retrieval tasks, PreMA can help participants complete their tasks more accurately and with fewer retries compared to a baseline approach.",

    "abstract": "When designing a software system, architects make a series of design decisions that directly impact the system's quality. The number of available design alternatives grows rapidly with system size, creating an enormous space of intertwined design concerns that renders manual exploration impractical. We present eQual, a model-driven technique for simulation-based assessment of architectural designs. While it is not possible to guarantee optimal decisions so early in the design process, eQual improves decision quality. eQual is effective in practice because it (1) limits the amount of information the architects have to provide and (2) adapts optimization algorithms to effectively explore massive spaces of design alternatives. We empirically demonstrate that eQual yields designs whose quality is comparable to a set of systems' known optimal designs. A user study shows that, compared to the state-of-the-art, engineers using eQual produce statistically significantly higher-quality designs with a large effect size, are statistically significantly more confident in their designs, and find eQual easier to use.",

    "abstract": "Using online Q&A forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO), for guidance to resolve program bugs, among other development issues, is commonplace in modern software development practice. Runtime exceptions (RE) is one such important class of bugs that is actively discussed on SO. In this work we present a technique and prototype tool called MAESTRO that can automatically recommend an SO post that is most relevant to a given Java RE in a developer's code. MAESTRO compares the exception-generating program scenario in the developer's code with that discussed in an SO post and returns the post with the closest match. To extract and compare the exception scenario effectively, MAESTRO first uses the answer code snippets in a post to implicate a subset of lines in the post's question code snippet as responsible for the exception and then compares these lines with the developer's code in terms of their respective Abstract Program Graph (APG) representations. The APG is a simplified and abstracted derivative of an abstract syntax tree, proposed in this work, that allows an effective comparison of the functionality embodied in the high-level program structure, while discarding many of the low-level syntactic or semantic differences. We evaluate MAESTRO on a benchmark of 78 instances of Java REs extracted from the top 500 Java projects on GitHub and show that MAESTRO can return either a highly relevant or somewhat relevant SO post corresponding to the exception instance in 71\\% of the cases, compared to relevant posts returned in only 8\\% - 44\\% instances, by four competitor tools based on state-of-the-art techniques. We also conduct a user experience study of MAESTRO with 10 Java developers, where the participants judge MAESTRO reporting a highly relevant or somewhat relevant post in 80\\% of the instances. In some cases the post is judged to be even better than the one manually found by the participant.",

Research shows these peer interactions are useful for improving developer behaviors, or the adoption of activities to help software engineers complete programming tasks.

One form of online recommendations between developers are pull requests, which allow users to propose code changes and provide feedback on contributions. GitHub, a popular code hosting platform, recently introduced the suggested changes feature, which allows users to recommend improvements for pull requests. To better understand this feature and its impact on recommendations between developers, we report an empirical study of this system, measuring usage, effectiveness, and perception. Our results show that suggested changes support code review activities and significantly impact the timing and communication between developers on pull requests.

While the Intel SGX architecture exports an ISA with low-level instructions that enable applications to create enclaves, the task of writing applications using this ISA has been left to the software community.  We consider the problem of porting legacy applications to SGX enclaves. In the approximately four years to date since the Intel SGX became commercially available, the community has developed three different models to port applications to enclaves---the library OS, the library wrapper, and the instruction wrapper models.  In this paper, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the merits and costs of each model. We report on our attempt to port a handful of real-world application benchmarks (including OpenSSL, Memcached, a Web server and a Python interpreter) to SGX enclaves using prototypes that embody each of the above models. Our evaluation focuses on the merits and costs of each of these models from the perspective of the effort required to port code under each of these models, the effort to re-engineer an application to work with enclaves, the security offered by each model, and the runtime performance of the applications under these models.",

    "abstract": "Credit scoring systems are critical FinTech applications that concern the analysis of the creditworthiness of a person or organization. While decisions were previously based on human expertise, they are now increasingly relying on data analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we assess the ability of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning to craft attacks on a real-world credit scoring system. Interestingly, we find that, while these techniques can generate large numbers of adversarial data, these are practically useless as they all violate domain-specific constraints. In other words, the generated examples are all false positives as they cannot occur in practice. To circumvent this limitation, we propose CoEvA2, a search-based method that generates valid adversarial examples (satisfying the domain constraints). CoEvA2 utilizes multi-objective search in order to simultaneously handle constraints, perform the attack and maximize the overdraft amount requested. We evaluate CoEvA2 on a major bank's real-world system by checking its ability to craft valid attacks. CoEvA2 generates thousands of valid adversarial examples, revealing a high risk for the banking system. Fortunately, by improving the system through adversarial training (based on the produced examples), we increase its robustness and make our attack fail.",

    "abstract": "Mastering the knowledge about security-sensitive functions that can potentially result in bugs is valuable to detect them. However, identifying this kind of functions is not a trivial task. Introducing machine learning-based techniques to do the task is a natural choice. Unfortunately, the approach also requires considerable prior knowledge, e.g., sufficient labelled training samples. In practice, the requirement is often hard to meet.  In this paper, to solve the problem, we propose a novel and practical method called SinkFinder to automatically discover function pairs that we are interested in, which only requires very limited prior knowledge. SinkFinder first takes just one pair of well-known interesting functions as the initial seed to infer enough positive and negative training samples by means of sub-word word embedding. By using these samples, a support vector machine classifier is trained to identify more interesting function pairs. Finally, checkers equipped with the obtained knowledge can be easily developed to detect bugs in target systems. The experiments demonstrate that SinkFinder can successfully discover hundreds of interesting functions and detect dozens of previously unknown bugs from large-scale systems, such as Linux, OpenSSL and PostgreSQL.",

In this work, we propose a novel approach Baital, based on adaptive weighted sampling using literal weighted functions, to generate test sets with high t-wise coverage.

To investigate the magnitude of the threat, we conducted an empirical evaluation using 10 real-world programs. The results reveal that: i) percentages of randomly sampled mutants differ from the true execution time, on average, by 44\\%, varying in difference from 19\\% to 91\\%; ii) errors arising from using the surrogate correlate with program size (œÅ = 0.74) and number of mutants (œÅ = 0.76), making the problem more pernicious for more realistic programs; iii) scientific findings concerning sampling strategies would have approximately 37\\% rank disagreement, indicating potentially dramatic impact on experiment validity. To investigate whether this threat matters in practice, we reproduced a seminal study on Selective Mutation (widely relied upon for more than two decades).

    "abstract": "Database Management Systems (DBMS) are used ubiquitously. To efficiently access data, they apply sophisticated optimizations. Incorrect optimizations can result in logic bugs, which cause a query to compute an incorrect result set. We propose Non-Optimizing Reference Engine Construction (NoREC), a fully-automatic approach to detect optimization bugs in DBMS. Conceptually, this approach aims to evaluate a query by an optimizing and a non-optimizing version of a DBMS, to then detect differences in their returned result set, which would indicate a bug in the DBMS. Obtaining a non-optimizing version of a DBMS is challenging, because DBMS typically provide limited control over optimizations. Our core insight is that a given, potentially randomly-generated optimized query can be rewritten to one that the DBMS cannot optimize. Evaluating this unoptimized query effectively corresponds to a non-optimizing reference engine executing the original query. We evaluated NoREC in an extensive testing campaign on four widely-used DBMS, namely PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and CockroachDB. We found 159 previously unknown bugs in the latest versions of these systems, 141 of which have been fixed by the developers. Of these, 51 were optimization bugs, while the remaining were error and crash bugs. Our results suggest that NoREC is effective, general and requires little implementation effort, which makes the technique widely applicable in practice.",

    "abstract": "Code coverage analysis plays an important role in the software testing process. More recently, the remarkable effectiveness of coverage feedback has triggered a broad interest in feedback-guided fuzzing. In this work, we introduce bcov, a tool for binary-level coverage analysis. Our tool statically instruments x86-64 binaries in the ELF format without compiler support. We implement several techniques to improve efficiency and scale to large real-world software. First, we bring Agrawal‚Äôs probe pruning technique to binary-level instrumentation and effectively leverage its superblocks to reduce overhead. Second, we introduce sliced microexecution, a robust technique for jump table analysis which improves CFG precision and enables us to instrument jump table entries. Additionally, smaller instructions in x86-64 pose a challenge for inserting detours. To address this challenge, we aggressively exploit padding bytes and systematically host detours in neighboring basic blocks.  We evaluate bcov on a corpus of 95 binaries compiled from eight popular and well-tested packages like FFmpeg and LLVM. Two instrumentation policies, with different edge-level precision, are used to patch all functions in this corpus - over 1.6 million functions. Our precise policy has average performance and memory overheads of 14\\% and 22\\% respectively. Instrumented binaries do not introduce any test regressions. The reported coverage is highly accurate with an average F-score of 99.86\\%. Finally, our jump table analysis is comparable to that of IDA Pro on gcc binaries and outperforms it on clang binaries.",

In this paper, we propose GAssert (Genetic ASSERTion improvement), the first technique to automatically improve assertion oracles.

Our empirical evaluation on 34 Java methods from 7 different Java code bases shows that GAssert effectively improves assertion oracles.

The most advanced smart home environments allow developers to write apps to make smart home devices work together to accomplish tasks, e.g., home security and energy conservation. A smart home app typically implements narrow functionality and thus to fully implement desired functionality homeowners may need to install multiple apps. These different apps can conflict with each other and these conflicts can result in undesired actions such as locking the door during a fire.  In this paper, we study conflicts between apps on Samsung SmartThings, the most popular platform for developing and deploying smart home IoT devices. By collecting and studying 198 official and 69 third-party apps, we found significant app conflicts in 3 categories: (1) close to 60\\% of app pairs that access the same device, (2) more than 90\\% of app pairs with physical interactions, and (3) around 11\\% of app pairs that access the same global variable. Our results suggest that the problem of conflicts between smart home apps is serious and can create potential safety risks. We then developed a conflict detection tool that uses model checking to automatically detect up to 96\\% of the conflicts.",

Despite extensive study on ML models, it still lacks a comprehensive empirical study towards understanding the ML model roles, peculiar architecture, and complexity of ADS (i.e., various ML models and their relationship with non-trivial code logic). In this paper, we conduct an in-depth case study on Apollo, which is one of the state-of-the-art ADS, widely adopted by major automakers worldwide. We took the first step to reveal the integration of the underlying ML models and code logic in Apollo. In particular, we study the Apollo source code and present the underlying ML model system architecture. We present our findings on how the ML models interact with each other, and how the ML models are integrated with code logic to form a complex system. Finally, we inspect Apollo in a dynamic view and notice the heavy use of model-relevant components and the lack of adequate tests in general. Our study reveals potential maintenance challenges of complex ML-powered systems and identifies future directions to improve the quality assurance of ADS and general ML systems.",

    "title": "Adapting bug prediction models to predict reverted commits at Wayfair",
    "author": "Suh, Alexander",
    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed many algorithms to predict software bugs. Given a software entity (e.g., a file or method), these algorithms predict whether the entity is bug-prone. However, since these algorithms cannot identify specific bugs, this does not tend to be particularly useful in practice. In this work, we adapt this prior work to the related problem of predicting whether a commit is likely to be reverted. Given the batch nature of continuous integration deployment at scale, this allows developers to find time-sensitive bugs in production more quickly. The models in this paper are based on features extracted from the revision history of a codebase that are typically used in bug prediction. Our experiments, performed on the three main repositories for the Wayfair website, show that our models can rank reverted commits above 80\\% of non-reverted commits on average. Moreover, when given to Wayfair developers, our models reduce the amount of time needed to find certain kinds of bugs by 55\\%. Wayfair continues to use our findings and models today to help find bugs during software deployments.",

    "abstract": "A critical issue in software development projects in IT service companies is finding the right people at the right time. By enabling assignments of tasks to people to be more fluid, the use of crowdsourcing approaches within a company offers a potential solution to this challenge. Inside a company, as multiple system development projects are ongoing separately, developers with slack time on one project might use this time to contribute to other projects. In this paper, we report on a case study of the application of crowdsourcing within an industrial web application system development project in a large telecommunications company. Developers worked with system specifications which were organized into a set of microtasks, offering a set of short and self-contained descriptions. When crowd workers in other projects had slack time, they fetched and completed microtasks. Our results offer initial evidence for the potential value of microtask programming in increasing the fluidity of team assignments within a company. Crowd contributors to the project were able to onboard and contribute to a new project in less than 2 hours. After onboarding, the crowd workers were together able to successfully implement a small program which contained only a small number of defects. Interview and survey data gathered from project participants revealed that crowd workers reported that they perceived onboarding costs to be reduced and did not experience issues with the reduced face to face communication, but experienced challenges with motivation.",

    "abstract": "For large industrial applications, system test cases are still often described in natural language (NL), and their number can reach thousands. Test automation is to automatically execute the test cases. Achieving test automation typically requires substantial manual effort for creating executable test scripts from these NL test cases. In particular, given that each NL test case consists of a sequence of NL test steps, testers first implement a test API method for each test step and then write a test script for invoking these test API methods sequentially for test automation. Across different test cases, multiple test steps can share semantic similarities, supposedly mapped to the same API method. However, due to numerous test steps in various NL forms under manual inspection, testers may not realize those semantically similar test steps and thus waste effort to implement duplicate test API methods for them. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new approach based on natural language processing to cluster similar NL test steps together such that the test steps in each cluster can be mapped to the same test API method. Our approach includes domain-specific word embedding training along with measurement based on Relaxed Word Mover‚ÄôsDistance to analyze the similarity of test steps. Our approach also includes a technique to combine hierarchical agglomerative clustering and K-means clustering post-refinement to derive high-quality and manually-adjustable clustering results. The evaluation results of our approach on a large industrial mobile app, WeChat, show that our approach can cluster the test steps with high accuracy, substantially reducing the number of clusters and thus reducing the downstream manual effort. In particular, compared with the baseline approach, our approach achieves 79.8\\% improvement on cluster quality, reducing 65.9\\% number of clusters, i.e., the number of test API methods to be implemented.",

Despite many issues can be handled by the support team, sometimes the customer issues can not be easily solved, thus raising customer incidents. Quick troubleshooting of a customer incident is critical. To this end, a customer incident should be assigned to its responsible team accurately in a timely manner. Our industrial experiences show that linking customer incidents with detected system incidents can help the customer incident triage. In particular, our empirical study on 7 real cloud service systems shows that with the additional information about the system incidents (i.e., incident reports generated by system monitors), the triage time of customer incidents can be accelerated 13.1\\texttimes{} on average. Based on this observation, in this paper, we propose LinkCM, a learning based approach to automatically link customer incidents to monitor reported system incidents. LinkCM incorporates a novel learning-based model that effectively extracts related information from two resources, and a transfer learning strategy is proposed to help LinkCM achieve better performance without huge amount of data. The experimental results indicate that LinkCM is able to achieve accurate link prediction. Furthermore, case studies are presented to demonstrate how LinkCM can help the customer incident triage procedure in real production cloud service systems.",

Such identification has two benefits compared with traditional module-level defect identification, i.e., identifying defects in a more cost-effective and efficient manner. Recently, researchers have proposed various effort-aware JIT defect identification approaches, including supervised (e.g., CBS+, OneWay) and unsupervised approaches (e.g., LT and Code Churn). The comparison of the effectiveness between such supervised and unsupervised approaches has attracted a large amount of research interest. However, the effectiveness of the recently proposed approaches and the comparison among them have never been investigated in an industrial setting.  In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art effort-aware JIT defect identification approaches in an industrial setting. To that end, we conduct a case study on 14 Alibaba projects with 196,790 changes. In our case study, we investigate three aspects: (1) The effectiveness of state-of-the-art supervised (i.e., CBS+,OneWay, EALR) and unsupervised (i.e., LT and Code Churn) effortaware JIT defect identification approaches on Alibaba projects, (2) the importance of the features used in the effort-aware JIT defect identification approach, and (3) the association between projectspecific factors and the likelihood of a defective change.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has become one of the most successful machine learning techniques. To achieve the optimal development result, there are emerging requirements on the interoperability between DL frameworks that the trained model files and training/serving programs can be re-utilized. Faithful model conversion is a promising technology to enhance the framework interoperability in which a source model is transformed into the semantic equivalent in another target framework format. However, several major challenges need to be addressed. First, there are apparent discrepancies between DL frameworks. Second, understanding the semantics of a source model could be difficult due to the framework scheme and optimization. Lastly, there exist a large number of DL frameworks, bringing potential significant engineering efforts.  In this paper, we propose MMdnn, an open-sourced, comprehensive, and faithful model conversion tool for popular DL frameworks. MMdnn adopts a novel unified intermediate representation (IR)-based methodology to systematically handle the conversion challenges. The source model is first transformed into an intermediate computation graph represented by the simple graph-based IR of MMdnn and then to the target framework format, which greatly reduces the engineering complexity. Since the model structure expressed by developers may have been changed by DL frameworks (e.g., graph optimization), MMdnn tries to recover the original high-level neural network layers for better semantic comprehension via a pattern matching similar method. In the meantime, a piece of model construction code is generated to facilitate later retraining or serving. MMdnn implements an extensible conversion architecture from the compilation point of view, which eases contribution from the community to support new DL operators and frameworks. MMdnn has reached good maturity and quality, and is applied for converting production models.",

As software-development processes are distributed among such organizational units; and are constantly transformed to fulfill new domain regulations, address changing customer requirements, or adopt new software-engineering methods; it is challenging to ensure, measure, and steer‚Äîessentially monitor‚Äîthe quality of the resulting systems. One means to facilitate such monitoring throughout whole software-development processes are key performance indicators, which provide a consolidated analysis of an organizations‚Äô performance. However, it is also challenging to introduce key performance indicators for the software development of a large organization, as they must be implemented at and accepted by all relevant organizational units.

We describe i) our methodology; ii) how we customized and use key performance indicators; iii) benefits achieved, namely improved monitoring and comparability, which help to define quality-improving actions; iv) and six lessons learned. These insights are helpful for other practitioners, providing an overview of a methodology they can adopt to assess the feasibility of key performance indicators as well as their benefits.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted by a variety of software-intensive systems. Developers mainly use GPUs to accelerate the training, testing, and deployment of DL models. However, the GPU memory consumed by a DL model is often unknown to them before the DL job executes. Therefore, an improper choice of neural architecture or hyperparameters can cause such a job to run out of the limited GPU memory and fail. Our recent empirical study has found that many DL job failures are due to the exhaustion of GPU memory. This leads to a horrendous waste of computing resources and a significant reduction in development productivity. In this paper, we propose DNNMem, an accurate estimation tool for GPU memory consumption of DL models. DNNMem employs an analytic estimation approach to systematically calculate the memory consumption of both the computation graph and the DL framework runtime. We have evaluated DNNMem on 5 real-world representative models with different hyperparameters under 3 mainstream frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet). Our extensive experiments show that DNNMem is effective in estimating GPU memory consumption.",

In order to reduce project management overheads and improve productivity, a global information and communication technology enterprise institutionalizes an organization wide small-team practice, called fireteams, to tackle the problems arising from human and social aspects, such as amicability, talent, skill, and communications. This paper reports a mixed-method research, which combines archive analysis, interviews and survey, to empirically investigate the characteristics and impacts of fireteam in this industrial setting. We identify three categories of fireteam in terms of its demonstrated characteristics: ordinary agile team with extensions, single-function team, and entire life-cycle team; elaborate four key activities of fireteam, i.e. team formation, maintenance, communication, and meeting. Less communication and management overheads, higher agility \\& concurrency, and improved personal ability are the three important contributors that increase the productivity of fireteams. Whereas management \\& leadership effort, divergent understanding of fireteam, and self-organized team are discovered as the three major problems associated with fireteams. Although the benefits of fireteam can be observed from its adoption, this practice does not achieve the enterprise‚Äôs anticipations very well.

FREPA is an outcome of the seamless collaboration between the academy and industry over the last eight years. The main contributions of this paper include 1) an automated and systematic engineering approach FREPA to construct requirement models, validate and verify systems in the aerospace and aviation control domain, 2) a domain-specific modeling language AASRDL to describe the formal specification, and 3) a practical FREPA-based tool AeroReq which has been used by our industry partners. We have successfully adopted FREPA to seven real aerospace gesture control and two aviation engine control systems.

    "abstract": "Microservice systems are highly dynamic and complex. For such systems, operation engineers and developers highly rely on trace analysis to understand architectures and diagnose various problems such as service failures and quality degradation. However, the huge number of traces produced at runtime makes it challenging to capture the required information in real-time. To address the faced challenges, in this paper, we propose a graph-based microservice trace analysis approach GMTA for understanding architecture and diagnosing various problems. Built on a graph-based representation, GMTA includes efficient processing of traces produced on the fly. It abstracts traces into different paths and further groups them into business flows. To support various analytical applications, GMTA includes an efficient storage and access mechanism by combining a graph database and a real-time analytics database and using a carefully designed storage structure. Based on GMTA, we construct analytical applications for architecture understanding and problem diagnosis, these applications support various needs such as visualizing service dependencies, making architectural decisions, analyzing the changes of services behaviors, detecting performance issues, and locating root causes. GMTA has been implemented and deployed in eBay. An experimental study based on trace data produced by eBay demonstrates GMTA's effectiveness and efficiency for architecture understanding and problem diagnosis. Case studies conducted in eBay's monitoring team and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team further confirm GMTA's substantial benefits in industrial-scale microservice systems.",

    "author": "W\\\"{u}stholz, Valentin and Christakis, Maria",
    "abstract": "We present Harvey, an industrial greybox fuzzer for smart contracts, which are programs managing accounts on a blockchain.  Greybox fuzzing is a lightweight test-generation approach that effectively detects bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs to exercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code that is guarded by narrow checks. Moreover, most real-world smart contracts transition through many different states during their lifetime, e.g., for every bid in an auction. To explore these states and thereby detect deep vulnerabilities, a greybox fuzzer would need to generate sequences of contract transactions, e.g., by creating bids from multiple users, while keeping the search space and test suite tractable.  In this paper, we explain how Harvey alleviates both challenges with two key techniques. First, Harvey extends standard greybox fuzzing with a method for predicting new inputs that are more likely to cover new paths or reveal vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Second, it fuzzes transaction sequences in a targeted and demand-driven way. We have evaluated our approach on 27 real-world contracts. Our experiments show that our techniques significantly increase Harvey's effectiveness in achieving high coverage and detecting vulnerabilities, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, more and more traditional shrink-wrapped software is provided as 7x24 online services. Incidents (events that lead to service disruptions or outages) could affect service availability and cause great financial loss. Therefore, mitigating the incidents is important and time critical. In practice, a document describing a mitigation process, called a troubleshooting guide (TSG), is usually used to reduce the Time To Mitigate (TTM). To investigate the usage of TSGs in real-world online services, we conduct the first empirical study on 18 real-world, large-scale online service systems in Microsoft. We analyze the distribution and characteristics of TSGs among all incident records in the past two years. According to our study, 27.2\\% incidents have TSG records and 36.2\\% of them occurred at least twice. Besides, on average developers spend around 36.3\\% of the entire mitigation time on locating the desired TSGs.  Our study shows that incidents could occur repeatedly and TSGs could be reused to facilitate incident mitigation. Motivated by our empirical study, we propose an automated TSG recommendation approach, DeepRmd, by leveraging the textual similarity between incident description and its corresponding TSG using deep learning techniques. We evaluate the effectiveness of DeepRmd on 18 online service systems. The results show that DeepRmd can recommend the correct TSG as the Top 1 returned result for 80.3\\% incidents, which significantly outperforms two baseline approaches.",

    "author": "Araujo, Frederico and Taylor, Teryl",
    "abstract": "Vulnerability patch management remains one of the most complex issues facing modern enterprises; companies struggle to test and deploy new patches across their networks, often leaving myriad attack vectors vulnerable to exploits. This problem is exacerbated by enterprise server applications, which expose tremendous amounts of information about their security postures, greatly expediting attackers' reconnaissance incursions (e.g., knowledge gathering attacks). Unfortunately, current patching processes offer no insights into attacker activities, and prompt attack remediation is hindered by patch compatibility considerations and deployment cycles.  To reverse this asymmetry, a patch management model is proposed to facilitate the rapid injection of software patches into live, commodity applications without disruption of production workflows, and the transparent sandboxing of suspicious processes for counterreconnaissance and threat information gathering. Our techniques improve workload visibility and vulnerability management, and overcome perennial shortcomings of traditional patching methodologies, such as proneness to attacker fingerprinting, and the high cost of deployment. The approach enables a large variety of novel defense scenarios, including rapid security patch testing with prompt recovery from defective patches and the placement of exploit sensors inlined into production workloads. An implementation for six enterprise-grade server programs demonstrates that our approach is practical and incurs minimal runtime overheads. Moreover, four use cases are discussed, including a practical deployment on two public cloud environments.",

    "abstract": "Online sports betting is a $50B industry that is heavily driven by software. The domain imposes significant demands on developers: the resulting solutions are large, complex, distributed, concurrent software systems with strict availability, real-time performance, scalability, reliability, and security requirements. This paper describes our experience with EmpireBet, a family of online sports betting platforms built and deployed over the past 15 years. The initial solution, implemented by four developers in a start-up, catered to users who connected to the system intermittently, for limited periods, via dial-up connections. Today‚Äôs system, engineered and maintained in 27 programming and markup languages by a team of 20 developers, is deployed in over 30 countries, integrated with over 50 third-party systems, and processes tens of millions daily transactions by over 680,000 players who are continuously using the system. This was accomplished via an an explicit focus on EmpireBet‚Äôs critical non-functional requirements; a modular, extensible architecture; a set of novel abstractions we introduced into the system; and several reusable libraries developed in the process.",

    "title": "Reducing DNN labelling cost using surprise adequacy: an industrial case study for autonomous driving",
    "author": "Kim, Jinhan and Ju, Jeongil and Feldt, Robert and Yoo, Shin",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are rapidly being adopted by the automotive industry, due to their impressive performance in tasks that are essential for autonomous driving. Object segmentation is one such task: its aim is to precisely locate boundaries of objects and classify the identified objects, helping autonomous cars to recognise the road environment and the traffic situation. Not only is this task safety critical, but developing a DNN based object segmentation module presents a set of challenges that are significantly different from traditional development of safety critical software. The development process in use consists of multiple iterations of data collection, labelling, training, and evaluation. Among these stages, training and evaluation are computation intensive while data collection and labelling are manual labour intensive. This paper shows how development of DNN based object segmentation can be improved by exploiting the correlation between Surprise Adequacy (SA) and model performance. The correlation allows us to predict model performance for inputs without manually labelling them. This, in turn, enables understanding of model performance, more guided data collection, and informed decisions about further training. In our industrial case study the technique allows cost savings of up to 50\\% with negligible evaluation inaccuracy. Furthermore, engineers can trade off cost savings versus the tolerable level of inaccuracy depending on different development phases and scenarios.",

    "author": "Wang, Jie and Wu, Yunguang and Zhou, Gang and Yu, Yiming and Guo, Zhenyu and Xiong, Yingfei",
    "abstract": "In Alibaba, we have seen a growing demand for tracing data flow for scenarios such as data leak detection, change governance, and data consistency checking. Static taint analysis is a technique for such problems, and many approaches are proposed for high scalability and precision. This paper shares our experience in applying taint analysis in Alibaba. In particular, we find that the state-of-the-art taint analysis tool, FlowDroid, does not work well in our cases because our applications make heavy use of libraries, native methods and enterprise-specific frameworks, which impose two major challenges, scalability and implicit dependency, to FlowDroid. This paper presents ANTaint to address these problems. ANTaint improves scalability by expanding the call graph and applying taint propagation on demand for libraries, which account for majority of the program execution but only a small fraction propagates taints. To improve accuracy, we ensure to build a sound call graph with its core part having certain accuracy, and providing a more precise taint propagation model. The practice of applying ANTaint in the company workload validates the idea. According to an experiment on 60 production cases, ANTaint is correct for 95\\% of the cases (precision: 95\\%, recall: 98\\%) while FlowDroid is 13\\%. ANTaint takes 65\\% less time and none of the cases run out of memory with 32 GB limitation.",

In this paper, we propose WebRR, a self-replay enhanced robust record-and-replay technique for Web applications testing. The novelty of WebRR is that, it introduces a new self-replay mechanism in the recording phase, which checks the captured event from the record module online, and generates multiple locators (including DOM locators, visual locator and proximity locators) automatically, to improve the robustness of generated test cases. During the replay, it combines multiple locators and new local workflow repair technique to repair test breakages, and can improve the resilience of generated tests to frequent updates of the applications. We applied our approach to 3 enterprise Web applications, which are deployed in a large power grid company of China. The experimental results show that WebRR is effective, and substantially improve the robustness of end-to-end web tests that are generated using record-and-replay technique.",

Real-world systems comprise many individual highly-configurable software components, making the space of possible configurations for the whole system enormous. To realize our vision and overcome these challenges, we aim to create a rigorous definition of configuration specifications, use formal methods to mechanize the inference and generation of valid configurations, and develop algorithms to automatically secure against misconfiguration.",

With the sophisticated functionality, however, comes the underlying complexity that grows overwhelmingly year by year.

Rather, from time to time, the consequences of complexity surface in forms of ultra-high design efforts, waves of defect reports, and explosions of warranty costs.

Many open source projects are reused or updated for various purposes that include fixing bugs in existing projects, development and maintenance of project extensions. Developers who interact with the projects might require documentation for better comprehension of the project and to develop extensions. Most of the software projects currently do not have sufficient documentation or it is not updated along with the project. If some projects have reasonably sufficient documentation, it is usually difficult to comprehend it either for maintenance or for reuse purposes. Considering the usefulness of Augmented Reality (AR) towards comprehension, we propose the vision of integrating the domains of augmented reality and software documentation, and specifically, visualization of software documentation using AR. In this paper, we present some of the directions that could be explored towards this vision and also present an example visualization scenario for API documentation using neural system metaphor. We see this paper as a basis for the future research direction of leveraging AR towards making documentation as a primary artifact in the software development process.",

Here we present a new approach to test machine learning code using the possible input region obtained as a polyhedron. If an ML system generates different output for multiple input in the polyhedron, it is ensured that there exists a bug in the code. This property is known as one of theoretical fundamentals in statistical inference, for example, sparse regression models such as the lasso, and a wide range of machine learning algorithms satisfy this polyhedral condition, to which our testing procedure can be applied. We empirically show that the existence of bugs in lasso code can be effectively detected by our method in the mutation testing framework.",

By visual semantics, we mean the semantic description about the software‚Äôs behaviors that are exhibited in its visual outputs. VSL works by composing this description based on visual element labels extracted from these outputs through image/video understanding and natural language generation. The result of VSL can then support tasks that may benefit from the high-level functional description. Just like a developer relies on program understanding to conduct many of such tasks, automatically understanding software (i.e., by machine rather than by human developers) is necessary to eventually enable fully automated software engineering. Apparently, VSL only works with software that does produce visual outputs that meaningfully demonstrate the software‚Äôs behaviors. Nevertheless, learning visual semantics would be a useful first step towards automated software understanding. We outline the design of our approach to VSL and present early results demonstrating its merits.",

Alloy is a mature tool-set that provides a first-order, rela- tional logic with transitive closure for writing the specifications, and a fully automatic backend based on propositional satisfiability (SAT) solvers for analyzing them. Alloy‚Äôs intuitive notation and sup- port for modern solvers make it a particularly effective specification and analysis tool, which has been applied in several domains, including verification, security, and synthesis. This paper introduces a new backend for Alloy, which complements SAT solvers, and provides a new method to assist Alloy users to more effectively use the tool-set, specifically in scenarios where multiple solutions to the same formula are desired. We add to the Alloy backend support for model counting, i.e., computing the number of solutions to the given formula. We extend the Alloy grammar to add a new com- mand for model counting, and extend the Alloy GUI to customize it. Our implementation, called AlloyMC, supports two state-of-the-art model counters: the approximate model counter ApproxMC and the exact model counter ProjMC. AlloyMC runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows. To use AlloyMC, users just download and run its integrated JAR file with no need to install dependencies (e.g., model counters and their dependent libraries).

Unfortunately, many code comments are missing, mismatched or outdated due to tight development schedule or other reasons. Automatic code comment generation is of great help for developers to comprehend source code and reduce their workload. Thus, we propose a code comment generation tool (DeepCommenter) to generate descriptive comments for Java methods. DeepCommenter formulates the comment generation task as a machine translation problem and exploits a deep neural network that combines the lexical and structural information of Java methods. We implement DeepCommenter in the form of an Integrated Development Environment (i.e., Intellij IDEA) plug-in. Such plug-in is built upon a Client/Server architecture. The client formats the code selected by the user, sends request to the server and inserts the comment generated by the server above the selected code. The server listens for client‚Äôs request, analyzes the requested code using the pre-trained model and sends back the generated comment to the client. The pre-trained model learns both the lexical and syntactical information from source code tokens and Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) respectively and combines these two types of information together to generate comments. To evaluate DeepCommenter, we conduct experiments on a large corpus built from a large number of open source Java projects on GitHub. The experimental results on different metrics show that DeepCommenter outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin.",

Such kind of localization is conducted at an early stage (e.g., when buggy program elements are being checked-in) which can be an early step of continuous quality control. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time defect identification and lOcalization tool, named JITO, which can help developers to locate defective lines at check-in time. In summary, JITO contains two phases: (i) identify if a new change is buggy and (ii) locate suspicious buggy code lines in the identified buggy changes. We implement JITO as a plugin in an integrated development environment (i.e., Intellij IDEA). When developers using our plugin, JITO loads the local Git repository to build the JIT defect identification model and localization model based on historical changes. After submitting a new change to the local repository, developers apply JITO to identify whether it is a buggy change. If a buggy change is identified, JITO leverages JIT defect localization model to locate its suspicious buggy lines and highlight them in Intellij IDEA. Experimental results show that JITO outperforms two baselines (i.e., random guess and a static bug finder (i.e., PMD)) by a substantial margin in terms of four ranking measures.

    "author": "El-Hajj, Rehab and Nadi, Sarah",
    "abstract": "Software developers heavily rely on third-party libraries to accomplish their programming tasks. Since many libraries offer similar functionality, it can be difficult and tedious for developers differentiate similar libraries in order to select the most suitable one. In our previous work, we proposed the idea of metric-based library comparisons that allow developers to compare various aspects of libraries within the same domain, empowering them with information to aid with their decision. In this paper we present an IntelliJ plugin, LibComp, that provides this library metric-based comparison technique right within the developer‚Äôs IDE. As soon as a developer adds a library dependency that LibComp has information about, LibComp will highlight this dependency to let the developer know that there are alternatives available. Once the user triggers the comparison for that library, they can view various metrics about the library and its alternatives and decide if they want to use one of the alternatives. In the process, LibComp also records the number of times the developer invokes the tool and any completed replacements. Such feedback, if optionally sent to us by the developer, provides us valuable insights into developers‚Äôreplacement decisions as well as information on how we can improve the tool. A video demonstrating the usage of LibComp can be found at https://youtu.be/YtEEdJan77A",

Mono2Micro consists of a set of tools that collect static and runtime information from a monolithic application and process the information using an AI-based technique to generate recommendations for partitioning the application classes. Each partition represents a candidate microservice or a grouping of classes with similar business functionalities. Mono2Micro takes a temporo-spatial clustering approach to compute meaningful and explainable partitions. It generates two types of partition recommendations. First, it computes business-logic-seams-based partitions that represent a desired encapsulation of business functionalities. However, such a recommendation may cut across data dependencies between classes, accommodating which could require significant application updates. To address this, Mono2Micro computes natural-seams-based partitions, which respect data dependencies. We describe the set of tools that comprise Mono2Micro and illustrate them using a well-known open-source JEE application.",

    "abstract": "Mutation testing is a time consuming process because large sets of fault-injected-versions of an original app are generated and executed with the purpose of evaluating the quality of a given test suite. In the case of Android apps, recent studies even suggest that mutant generation and mutation testing effort could be greater when the mutants are generated at the APK level. To reduce that effort, useless (e.g., equivalent) mutants should be avoided and mutant selection techniques could be used to reduce the set of mutants used with mutation testing. However, despite the existence of mutation testing tools, none of those tools provides features for removing useless mutants and sampling mutant sets. In this paper, we present MutAPK 2.0, an improved version of our open source mutant generation tool (MutAPK) for Android apps at APK level. To the best of our knowledge, MutAPK 2.0 is the first tool that enables the removal of dead-code mutants, provides a set of mutant selection strategies, and removes automatically equivalent and duplicate mutants.

As an example application of it, PCA readily supports memory leak detection, for which it helps achieve close or better performance and precision relative to the same application based on a state-of-the-art value flow analysis. In particular, it found four more memory leaks in an industry-scale system which have been fixed by the developers.

    "abstract": "Deciding termination of programs is probably the most famous problem in computer science. Synthesizing ranking functions for programs is a standard way to prove termination of programs. Currently, specific synthesis algorithms have to be developed for each specific type of programs. For instance, the synthesis of ranking functions for programs with linear variables updates is usually based on linear programming techniques and the like, while for programs with polynomial updates, it usually relies on semi-definite programming and the like. The same also applies to the synthesis of different types of ranking functions needed for proving program termination. Each time faced with a new type of programs and a new type of ranking functions, researchers have to spend a considerable amount of effort to develop specialized synthesis algorithms. In this paper, to save this extra effort, we present SVMRanker, a general framework for proving termination of programs, which is able to synthesize different types of ranking functions for programs with both linear and polynomial updates, based on Support-Vector Machines (SVM). We compare SVMRanker with the state-of-the-art tool LassoRanker on standard benchmarks. Empirical results show that SVMRanker is comparable with LassoRanker on programs with linear updates and can manage more programs with polynomial updates, making SVMRanker a valid complement to LassoRanker in proving program termination.",

Unlike existing tools, Threshy is designed to operate in multiple workflows including pre-development, pre-release, and support. Threshy is designed for tuning the confidence scores returned by intelligent web services and does not deal with hyper-parameter optimisation used in ML models.

Though several software debloating tools exist, none of them help developers gain insights into how under-utilized those libraries are nor help developers build confidence in the behavior preservation of software after debloating. To bridge this gap, we developed WebJShrink, a visual analytics tool for analyzing and pruning bloated software projects.

To illustrate the target project's behavior preservation, WebJShrink examines the debloated software with its JUnit tests and visualizes the test results.

We consider as a null hypothesis that from the perspective of the consumption of energy, there is no difference in writing apps in C, C++, and Java. With the studies at hand, we conclude that we cannot reject such null hypotheses.",

    "author": "Strugar, Dragos",
    "abstract": "Dashboards are software systems aiming to amplify cognition capitalizing on human perceptual abilities. As such, they have intrinsically a human-centric approach, meaning that their purpose is to support effective decision making. This has played a vital role in their success in business performance management, business intelligence, and internal control. However, as today's business requirements change rapidly and continuously, dashboards containing the same set of metrics throughout quickly become ineffective at conveying important information, especially when used by multiple users. This is one of the reasons for adopting the concept of \"precooked\" dashboards, i.e., building a default template that is useful to an average user.",

    "author": "Tian, Yuchi",
    "abstract": "Recent works in DNN testing show that DNN based image classifiers are susceptible to confusion and bias errors. A DNN model, even robust trained model can be highly confused between certain pair of objects or highly bias towards some object than others. In this paper, we propose a differentiable distance metric, which is highly correlated with confusion errors. We propose a repairing approach by increasing the distance between two classes during retraining the model to reduce the confusion errors. We evaluate our approaches on both single-label and multi-label classification models and datasets. Our results show that our approach effectively reduce confusion errors with very slight accuracy reduce.",

    "author": "Gisi, Joshua",
    "abstract": "Success using machine learning (ML) in numerous fields has created a new class of users, who are not experts in the data science domain but want to use ML as a means to solve their inference problems. Various automatic machine learning (AutoML) approaches attempt to make ML solutions accessible to such users. In this work, we present a system that automatically synthesizes correct code within the context of the user‚Äôs data using sketching. In sketching, insight is determined through a partial program; a sketch expresses the high-level structure of implementation but leaves holes in place of the low-level details. We use meta-learning on meta-features to approximately solve holes. We observe that the sketch-based approach is more expressive, easier to implement, and easier to optimize than existing AutoML frameworks. Our initial results are very promising. Our approach uses fewer resources and still produces comparable results to existing techniques.",
