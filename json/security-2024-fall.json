    "title": "Towards Generic Database Management System Fuzzing",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Database Management Systems play an indispensable role in modern cyberspace. While multiple fuzzing frameworks have been proposed in recent years to test relational (SQL) DBMSs to improve their security, non-relational (NoSQL) DBMSs have yet to experience the same scrutiny and lack an effective testing solution in general. In this work, we identify three limitations of existing approaches when extended to fuzz the DBMSs effectively in general: being non-generic, using static constraints, and generating loose data dependencies. Then, we propose effective solutions to address these limitations. We implement our solutions into an end-to-end fuzzing framework, BUZZBEE, which can effectively fuzz both relational and non-relational DBMSs. BUZZBEE successfully discovered 40 vulnerabilities in eight DBMSs of four different data models, of which 25 have been fixed with 4 new CVEs assigned. In our evaluation, BUZZBEE outperforms state-of-the-art generic fuzzers by up to 177% in terms of code coverage and discovers 30x more bugs than the second-best fuzzer for non-relational DBMSs, while achieving comparable results with specialized SQL fuzzers for the relational counterpart.",

    "title": "Speculative Denial-of-Service Attacks In Ethereum",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Transaction fees compensate actors for resources expended on transactions and can only be charged from transactions included in blocks. But, the expressiveness of Turing-complete contracts implies that verifying if transactions can be included requires executing them on the current blockchain state.In this work, we show that adversaries can craft malicious transactions that decouple the work imposed on blockchain actors from the compensation offered in return. We introduce three attacks: (i) ConditionalExhaust, a conditional resource-exhaustion attack against blockchain actors. (ii) MemPurge, an attack for evicting transactions from actors' mempools. (iii) GhostTX, an attack on the reputation system used in Ethereum's proposer-builder separation ecosystem.We evaluate our attacks on an Ethereum testnet and find that by combining ConditionalExhaust and MemPurge, adversaries can simultaneously burden victims' computational resources and clog their mempools to the point where victims are unable to include transactions in blocks. Thus, victims create empty blocks, thereby hurting the system's liveness. The attack's expected cost is $376, but becomes cheaper if adversaries are validators. For other attackers, costs decrease if censorship is prevalent in the network.ConditionalExhaust and MemPurge are made possible by inherent features of Turing-complete blockchains, and potential mitigations may result in reducing a ledger's scalability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Secure aggregation of high-dimensional vectors is a fundamental primitive in federated statistics and learning. A two-server system such as PRIO allows for scalable aggregation of secret-shared vectors. Adversarial clients might try to manipulate the aggregate, so it is important to ensure that each (secret-shared) contribution is well-formed. In this work, we focus on the important and well-studied goal of ensuring that each contribution vector has bounded Euclidean norm. Existing protocols for ensuring bounded-norm contributions either incur a large communication overhead, or only allow for approximate verification of the norm bound. We propose Private Inexpensive Norm Enforcement (PINE): a new protocol that allows exact norm verification with little communication overhead. For high-dimensional vectors, our approach has a communication overhead of a few percent, compared to the 16-32x overhead of previous approaches.",

    "title": "SHiFT: Semi-hosted Fuzz Testing for Embedded Applications",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Modern microcontrollers (MCU)s are ubiquitous on critical embedded applications in the IoT era. Therefore, securing MCU firmware is fundamental. To analyze MCU firmware security, existing works mostly adopt re-hosting based techniques. These techniques transplant firmware to an engineered platform and require tailored hardware or emulation of different parts of the MCU. As a result, security practitioners have observed low-fidelity, false positives, and reduced compatibility with real and complex hardware. This paper presents SHiFT, a framework that leverages the industry semihosting philosophy to provide a brandnew method that analyzes firmware natively in MCUs. This novel method provides high fidelity, reduces false positives, and grants compatibility with complex peripherals, asynchronous events, real-time operations, and direct memory access (DMA). We verified compatibility of SHiFT with thirteen popular embedded architectures, and fully evaluated prototypes for ARMv7-M, ARMv8-M and Xtensa architectures. Our evaluation shows that SHiFT can detect a wide range of firmware faults with instrumentation running natively in the MCU. In terms of performance, SHiFT is up to two orders of magnitude faster (i.e., ×100) than software-based emulation, and even comparable to fuzz testing native applications in a workstation. Thanks to SHiFT's unique characteristics, we discovered five previously unknown vulnerabilities, including a zero-day on the popular FreeRTOS kernel, with no false positives. Our prototypes and source code are publicly available athttps://github.com/RiS3-Lab/SHiFT.",

    "title": "Rise of Inspectron: Automated Black-box Auditing of Cross-platform Electron Apps",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Browser-based cross-platform applications have become increasingly popular as they allow software vendors to sidestep two major issues in the app ecosystem. First, web apps can be impacted by the performance deterioration affecting browsers, as the continuous adoption of diverse and complex features has led to bloating. Second, re-developing or porting apps to different operating systems and execution environments is a costly, error-prone process. Instead, frameworks like Electron allow the creation of standalone apps for different platforms using JavaScript code (e.g., reused from an existing web app) and by incorporating a stripped down and configurable browser engine. Despite the aforementioned advantages, these apps face significant security and privacy threats that are either non-applicable to traditional web apps (due to the lack of access to certain system-facing APIs) or ineffective against them (due to countermeasures already baked into browsers). In this paper we present Inspectron, an automated dynamic analysis framework that audits packaged Electron apps for potential security vulnerabilities stemming from developers' deviation from recommended security practices. Our study reveals a multitude of insecure practices and problematic trends in the Electron app ecosystem, highlighting the gap filled by Inspectron as it provides extensive and comprehensive auditing capabilities for developers and researchers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Wireless charging is becoming an increasingly popular charging solution in portable electronic products for a more convenient and safer charging experience than conventional wired charging. However, our research identified new vulnerabilities in wireless charging systems, making them susceptible to intentional electromagnetic interference. These vulnerabilities facilitate a set of novel attack vectors, enabling adversaries to manipulate the charger and perform a series of attacks.In this paper, we propose VoltSchemer, a set of innovative attacks that grant attackers control over commercial-off-the-shelf wireless chargers merely by modulating the voltage from the power supply. These attacks represent the first of its kind, exploiting voltage noises from the power supply to manipulate wireless chargers without necessitating any malicious modifications to the chargers themselves. The significant threats imposed by VoltSchemer are substantiated by three practical attacks, where a charger can be manipulated to: control voice assistants via inaudible voice commands, damage devices being charged through overcharging or overheating, and bypass Qi-standard specified foreign-object-detection mechanism to damage valuable items exposed to intense magnetic fields.We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the VoltSchemer attacks with successful attacks on 9 top-selling COTS wireless chargers. Furthermore, we discuss the security implications of our findings and suggest possible countermeasures to mitigate potential threats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Web crawlers are tools widely used in web security measurements whose performance and impact have been limitedly studied so far. In this paper, we bridge this gap. Starting from the past 12 years of the top security, web measurement, and software engineering literature, we categorize and decompose in building blocks crawling techniques and methodologic choices. We then reimplement and patch crawling techniques and integrate them into Arachnarium, a framework for comparative evaluations, which we use to run one of the most comprehensive experimental evaluations against nine real and two benchmark web applications and top 10K CrUX websites to assess the performance and adequacy of algorithms across three metrics (code, link, and JavaScript source coverage). Finally, we distill 14 insights and lessons learned. Our results show that despite a lack of clear and homogeneous descriptions hindering reimplementations, proposed and commonly used crawling algorithms offer a lower coverage than randomized ones, indicating room for improvement. Also, our results show a complex relationship between experiment parameters, the study's domain, and the available computing resources, where no single best-performing crawler configuration exists. We hope our results will guide future researchers when setting up their studies.",

    "title": "That Doesn't Go There: Attacks on Shared State in Multi-User Augmented Reality Applications",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Augmented Reality (AR) can enable shared virtual experiences between multiple users. In order to do so, it is crucial for multi-user AR applications to establish a consensus on the \"shared state\" of the virtual world and its augmentations through which users interact. Current methods to create and access shared state collect sensor data from devices (e.g., camera images), process them, and integrate them into the shared state. However, this process introduces new vulnerabilities and opportunities for attacks. Maliciously writing false data to \"poison\" the shared state is a major concern for the security of the downstream victims that depend on it. Another type of vulnerability arises when reading the shared state: by providing false inputs, an attacker can view hologram augmentations at locations they are not allowed to access. In this work, we demonstrate a series of novel attacks on multiple AR frameworks with shared states, focusing on three publicly accessible frameworks. We show that these frameworks, while using different underlying implementations, scopes, and mechanisms to read from and write to the shared state, have shared vulnerability to a unified threat model. Our evaluations of these state-of-the-art AR frameworks demonstrate reliable attacks both on updating and accessing the shared state across different systems. To defend against such threats, we discuss a number of potential mitigation strategies that can help enhance the security of multi-user AR applications and implement an initial prototype.",

    "title": "SDFuzz: Target States Driven Directed Fuzzing",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Directed fuzzers often unnecessarily explore program code and paths that cannot trigger the target vulnerabilities. We observe that the major application scenarios of directed fuzzing provide detailed vulnerability descriptions, from which highly-valuable program states (i.e., target states) can be derived, e.g., call traces when a vulnerability gets triggered. By driving to expose such target states, directed fuzzers can exclude massive unnecessary exploration.Inspired by the observation, we present SDFuzz, an efficient directed fuzzing tool driven by target states. SDFuzz first automatically extracts target states in vulnerability reports and static analysis results. SDFuzz employs a selective instrumentation technique to reduce the fuzzing scope to the required code for reaching target states. SDFuzz then early terminates the execution of a test case once SDFuzz probes that the remaining execution cannot reach the target states. It further uses a new target state feedback and refines prior imprecise distance metric into a two-dimensional feedback mechanism to proactively drive the exploration towards the target states.We thoroughly evaluated SDFuzz on known vulnerabilities and compared it to related works. The results show that SDFuzz could improve vulnerability exposure capability with more vulnerability triggered and less time used, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions. SDFuzz could significantly improve the fuzzing throughput. Our application of SDFuzz to automatically validate the static analysis results successfully discovered four new vulnerabilities in well-tested applications. Three of them have been acknowledged by developers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Asymmetric Searchable Encryption (ASE) is a promising cryptographic mechanism that enables a semi-trusted cloud server to perform keyword searches over encrypted data for users. To be useful, an ASE scheme must support expressive search queries, which are expressed as conjunction, disjunction, or any Boolean formulas. In this paper, we propose a fast and expressive ASE scheme that is adaptively secure, called FEASE. It requires only 3 pairing operations for searching any conjunctive set of keywords independent of the set size and has linear complexity for encryption and trapdoor algorithms in the number of keywords. FEASE is based on a new fast Anonymous Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (A-KP-ABE) scheme as our first proposal, which is of independent interest. To address optional protection against keyword guessing attacks, we extend FEASE into the first expressive Public-Key Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (PAEKS) scheme. We provide implementations and evaluate the performance of all three schemes, while also comparing them with the state of the art. We observe that FEASE outperforms all existing expressive ASE constructions and that our A-KP-ABE scheme offers anonymity with efficiency comparable to the currently fastest yet non-anonymous KP-ABE schemes FAME (ACM CCS 2017) and FABEO (ACM CCS 2022).",

    "title": "Critical Code Guided Directed Greybox Fuzzing for Commits",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Newly submitted commits are prone to introducing vulnerabilities into programs. As a promising countermeasure, directed greybox fuzzers can be employed to test commit changes by designating the commit change sites as targets. However, existing directed fuzzers primarily focus on reaching a single target and neglect the diverse exploration of the additional affected code. As a result, they may overlook bugs that crash at a distant site from the change site and lack directness in multi-target scenarios, which are both very common in the context of commit testing.In this paper, we propose WAFLGO, a direct greybox fuzzer, to effectively discover vulnerabilities introduced by commits. WAFLGO employs a novel critical code guided input generation strategy to thoroughly explore the affected code. Specifically, we identify two types of critical code: pathprefix code and data-suffix code. The critical code first guides the input generation to gradually and incrementally reach the change sites. Then while maintaining the reachability of the critical code, the input generation strategy further encourages the diversity of the generated inputs in exploring the affected code. Additionally, WAFLGO introduces a lightweight multitarget distance metric for directness and thorough examination of all change sites. We implement WAFLGO and evaluate it with 30 real-world bugs introduced by commits. Compared to eight state-of-the-art tools, WAFLGO achieves an average speedup of 10.3×. Furthermore, WAFLGO discovers seven new vulnerabilities including four CVEs while testing the most recent 50 commits of real-world software, including libtiff, fig2dev, and libming, etc.",

This paper extends the notion of the page remapping attack to another type of code-reuse attack, which can not only be used for altering or sniffing kernel data but also for building and executing malicious code at runtime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack on state-of-the-art hardware and software, where control-flow integrity policies are enforced, thus highlighting its capability to render most legacy systems vulnerable.",

    "title": "A Linear Reconstruction Approach for Attribute Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Recent advances in synthetic data generation (SDG) have been hailed as a solution to the difficult problem of sharing sensitive data while protecting privacy. SDG aims to learn statistical properties of real data in order to generate \"artificial\" data that are structurally and statistically similar to sensitive data. However, prior research suggests that inference attacks on synthetic data can undermine privacy, but only for specific outlier records.In this work, we introduce a new attribute inference attack against synthetic data. The attack is based on linear reconstruction methods for aggregate statistics, which target all records in the dataset, not only outliers. We evaluate our attack on state-of-the-art SDG algorithms, including Probabilistic Graphical Models, Generative Adversarial Networks, and recent differentially private SDG mechanisms. By defining a formal privacy game, we show that our attack can be highly accurate even on arbitrary records, and that this is the result of individual information leakage (as opposed to population-level inference).We then systematically evaluate the tradeoff between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility. Our findings suggest that current SDG methods cannot consistently provide sufficient privacy protection against inference attacks while retaining reasonable utility. The best method evaluated, a differentially private SDG mechanism, can provide both protection against inference attacks and reasonable utility, but only in very specific settings. Lastly, we show that releasing a larger number of synthetic records can improve utility but at the cost of making attacks far more effective.",

Second, by incorporating contemporary social and critical theories, we establish guidelines for future studies of sociodemographic factors and security behaviors that address how to overcome common pitfalls. We present a case study to demonstrate our guidelines in action, at-scale, that conduct a measurement study of the relationships between sociodemographics and de-identified, aggregated log data of security and privacy behaviors among 16,829 users on Facebook across 16 countries. Through these contributions, we position our work as a systemization of a lack of knowledge (SoLK). Overall, we find contradictory results and vast unknowns about how identity shapes security behavior. Through our guidelines and discussion, we chart new directions to more deeply examine how and why sociodemographic factors affect security behaviors.",

    "title": "On the Difficulty of Defending Contrastive Learning against Backdoor Attacks",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Recent studies have shown that contrastive learning, like supervised learning, is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks wherein malicious functions are injected into target models, only to be activated by specific triggers. However, thus far it remains under-explored how contrastive backdoor attacks fundamentally differ from their supervised counterparts, which impedes the development of effective defenses against the emerging threat.This work represents a solid step toward answering this critical question. Specifically, we define TRL, a unified framework that encompasses both supervised and contrastive backdoor attacks. Through the lens of TRL, we uncover that the two types of attacks operate through distinctive mechanisms: in supervised attacks, the learning of benign and backdoor tasks tends to occur independently, while in contrastive attacks, the two tasks are deeply intertwined both in their representations and throughout their learning processes. This distinction leads to the disparate learning dynamics and feature distributions of supervised and contrastive attacks. More importantly, we reveal that the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks entail important implications from a defense perspective: existing defenses for supervised attacks are often inadequate and not easily retrofitted to contrastive attacks. We also explore several promising alternative defenses and discuss their potential challenges. Our findings highlight the need for defenses tailored to the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks, pointing to promising directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Recent studies have revealed that deep learning-based speaker recognition systems (SRSs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). However, the practicality of existing black-box AE attacks is restricted by the requirement for extensive querying of the target system or the limited attack success rates (ASR). In this paper, we introduce VoxCloak, a new targeted AE attack with superior performance in both these aspects. Distinct from existing methods that optimize AEs by querying the target model, VoxCloak initially employs a small number of queries (e.g., a few hundred) to infer the feature extractor used by the target system. It then utilizes this feature extractor to generate any number of AEs locally without the need for further queries. We evaluate VoxCloak on four commercial speaker recognition (SR) APIs and seven voice assistants. On the SR APIs, VoxCloak surpasses the existing transfer-based attacks, improving ASR by 76.25% and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 13.46 dB, as well as the decision-based attacks, requiring 33 times fewer queries and improving SNR by 7.87 dB while achieving comparable ASRs. On the voice assistants, VoxCloak outperforms the existing methods with a 49.40% improvement in ASR and a 15.79 dB improvement in SNR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Recently, deep learning has demonstrated promising results in enhancing the accuracy of vulnerability detection and identifying vulnerabilities in software. However, these techniques are still vulnerable to attacks. Adversarial examples can exploit vulnerabilities within deep neural networks, posing a significant threat to system security. This study showcases the susceptibility of deep learning models to adversarial attacks, which can achieve 100% attack success rate. The proposed method, EaTVul, encompasses six stages: identification of important adversarial samples using support vector machines, identification of important features using the attention mechanism, generation of adversarial data based on these features, preparation of an adversarial attack pool, selection of seed data using a fuzzy genetic algorithm, and the execution of an evasion attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EaTVul, achieving an attack success rate of more than 83% when the snippet size is greater than 2. Furthermore, in most cases with a snippet size of 4, EaTVul achieves a 100% attack success rate. The findings of this research emphasize the necessity of robust defenses against adversarial attacks in software vulnerability detection.",

    "title": "How Does a Deep Learning Model Architecture Impact Its Privacy? A Comprehensive Study of Privacy Attacks on CNNs and Transformers",
    "abstract": "Abstract:As a booming research area in the past decade, deep learning technologies have been driven by big data collected and processed on an unprecedented scale. However, privacy concerns arise due to the potential leakage of sensitive information from the training data. Recent research has revealed that deep learning models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks, including membership inference attacks, attribute inference attacks, and gradient inversion attacks. Notably, the efficacy of these attacks varies from model to model. In this paper, we answer a fundamental question: Does model architecture affect model privacy? By investigating representative model architectures from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to Transformers, we demonstrate that Transformers generally exhibit higher vulnerability to privacy attacks than CNNs. Additionally, we identify the micro design of activation layers, stem layers, and LN layers, as major factors contributing to the resilience of CNNs against privacy attacks, while the presence of attention modules is another main factor that exacerbates the privacy vulnerability of Transformers. Our discovery reveals valuable insights for deep learning models to defend against privacy attacks and inspires the research community to develop privacy-friendly model architectures.",

    "title": "Fast and Private Inference of Deep Neural Networks by Co-designing Activation Functions",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is an increasingly popular design where a company with abundant computing resources trains a deep neural network and offers query access for tasks like image classification. The challenge with this design is that MLaaS requires the client to reveal their potentially sensitive queries to the company hosting the model. Multi-party computation (MPC) protects the client's data by allowing encrypted inferences. However, current approaches suffer from prohibitively large inference times. The inference time bottleneck in MPC is the evaluation of non-linear layers such as ReLU activation functions. Motivated by the success of previous work co-designing machine learning and MPC, we develop an activation function co-design. We replace all ReLUs with a polynomial approximation and evaluate them with single-round MPC protocols, which give state-of-theart inference times in wide-area networks. Furthermore, to address the accuracy issues previously encountered with polynomial activations, we propose a novel training algorithm that gives accuracy competitive with plaintext models. Our evaluation shows between 3 and 110× speedups in inference time on large models with up to 23 million parameters while maintaining competitive inference accuracy.",

    "title": "Transferability of White-box Perturbations: Query-Efficient Adversarial Attacks against Commercial DNN Services",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing decision-based adversarial attacks require large numbers of queries to find an effective adversarial example, resulting in a heavy query cost and also performance degradation under defenses. In this paper, we propose the Dispersed Sampling Attack (DSA), which is a query-efficient decision-based adversarial attack by exploiting the transferability of white-box perturbations. DSA can generate diverse examples with different locations in the embedding space, which provides more information about the adversarial region of substitute models and allows us to search for transferable perturbations. Specifically, DSA samples in a hypersphere centered on an original image, and progressively constrains the perturbation. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets to evaluate the performance of DSA in closed-set and open-set scenarios. DSA outperforms the state-of-the-art attacks in terms of both attack success rate (ASR) and average number of queries (AvgQ). Specifically, DSA achieves an ASR of about 90% with an AvgQ of 200 on 4 well-known commercial DNN services.",

    "title": "Query Recovery from Easy to Hard: Jigsaw Attack against SSE",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Searchable symmetric encryption schemes often unintentionally disclose certain sensitive information, such as access, volume, and search patterns. Attackers can exploit such leakages and other available knowledge related to the user's database to recover queries. We find that the effectiveness of query recovery attacks depends on the volume/frequency distribution of keywords. Queries containing keywords with high volumes/frequencies are more susceptible to recovery, even when countermeasures are implemented. Attackers can also effectively leverage these \"special\" queries to recover all others.By exploiting the above finding, we propose a Jigsaw attack that begins by accurately identifying and recovering those distinctive queries. Leveraging the volume, frequency, and cooccurrence information, our attack achieves 90% accuracy in three tested datasets, which is comparable to previous attacks (Oya et al., USENIX' 22 and Damie et al., USENIX' 21). With the same runtime, our attack demonstrates an advantage over the attack proposed by Oya et al (approximately 15% more accuracy when the keyword universe size is 15k). Furthermore, our proposed attack outperforms existing attacks against widely studied countermeasures, achieving roughly 60% and 85% accuracy against the padding and the obfuscation, respectively. In this context, with a large keyword universe (≥3k), it surpasses current state-of-the-art attacks by more than 20%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Data minimization is a legal and privacy-by-design principle mandating that online services collect only data that is necessary for pre-specified purposes. While the principle has thus far mostly been interpreted from a system-centered perspective, there is a lack of understanding about how data minimization could be designed from a user-centered perspective, and in particular, what factors might influence user decision-making with regard to the necessity of data for different processing purposes. To address this gap, in this paper, we gain a deeper understanding of users' design expectations and decision-making processes related to data minimization, focusing on a case study of search engines. We also elicit expert evaluations of the feasibility of user-generated design ideas. We conducted interviews with 25 end users and 10 experts from the EU and UK to provide concrete design recommendations for data minimization that incorporate user needs, concerns, and preferences. Our study (i) surfaces how users reason about the necessity of data in the context of search result quality, and (ii) examines the impact of several factors on user decision-making about data processing, including specific types of search data, or the volume and recency of data. Most participants emphasized the particular importance of data minimization in the context of sensitive searches, such as political, financial, or health-related search queries. In a think-aloud conceptual design session, participants recommended search profile customization as a solution for retaining data they considered necessary, as well as alert systems that would inform users to minimize data in instances of excessive collection. We propose actionable design features that could provide users with greater agency over their data through user-controlled data minimization, combined with relevant implementation insights from experts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Integration of third-party SDKs are essential in the development of mobile apps. However, the rise of in-app privacy threat against mobile SDKs— called cross-library data harvesting (XLDH), targets social media/platform SDKs (called social SDKs) that handles rich user data. Given the widespread integration of social SDKs in mobile apps, XLDH presents a significant privacy risk, as well as raising pressing concerns regarding legal compliance for app developers, social media/platform stakeholders, and policymakers. The emerging XLDH threat, coupled with the increasing demand for privacy and compliance in line with societal expectations, introduces unique challenges that cannot be addressed by existing protection methods against privacy threats or malicious code on mobile platforms. In response to the XLDH threats, in our study, we generalize and define the concept of privacy-preserving social SDKs and their in-app usage, characterize fundamental challenges for combating the XLDH threat and ensuring privacy in design and utilizaiton of social SDKs. We introduce a practical, clean-slate design and end-to-end systems, called PESP, to facilitate privacy-preserving social SDKs. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates its satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and practicability for widespread adoption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Online learning is widely used in production to refine model parameters after initial deployment. This opens several vectors for covertly launching attacks against deployed models. To detect these attacks, prior work developed black-box and white-box testing methods. However, this has left prohibitive open challenge: how the investigator is supposed to recover the model (uniquely refined on an in-the-field device) for testing in the first place. We propose a novel memory forensic technique, named AiP, which automatically recovers the unique deployment model and rehosts it in a lab environment for investigation. AiP navigates through both main memory and GPU memory spaces to recover complex ML data structures, using recovered Python objects to guide the recovery of lower-level C objects, ultimately leading to the recovery of the uniquely refined model. AiP then rehosts the model within the investigator's device, where the investigator can apply various white-box testing methodologies. We have evaluated AiP using three versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch with the CIFAR-10, LISA, and IMDB datasets. AiP recovered 30 models from main memory and GPU memory with 100% accuracy and rehosted them into a live process successfully.",

    "title": "A Friend's Eye is A Good Mirror: Synthesizing MCU Peripheral Models from Peripheral Drivers",
    "abstract": "Abstract:The extensive integration of embedded devices within the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to significant security concerns. Various initiatives have been undertaken to bolster the security of these devices at the software level, involving the analysis of MCU firmware and the implementation of automatic MCU rehosting methods. However, existing hardware-oriented rehosting techniques often face scalability challenges, while firmware-oriented approaches may have limited universality and fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Perry, a system that synthesizes faithful and extendable peripheral models for MCUs. By extracting peripheral models from hardware drivers, Perry ensures compatibility and accurate emulation of targeted MCUs. The process involves gathering hardware metadata, analyzing driver code, capturing traces of peripheral accesses, and converting software beliefs into hardware behaviors. Perry is implemented with approximately 19,000 lines of code. A comprehensive evaluation of 75 firmware samples has showcased its effectiveness, consistency, universality, and scalability in generating hardware models for MCUs. Perry can efficiently synthesize hardware models consistent with the actual hardware and achieve a 74.24% unit test passing rate, outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques. The hardware models produced by Perry can faithfully emulate diverse firmware and can be readily expanded with minimal manual intervention. Through case studies, we show that Perry can help reproduce firmware vulnerabilities, discover specification-violation bugs in drivers, and fuzz RTOS for vulnerabilities. These case studies have led to the identification of two specification-violating bugs and the discovery of seven new vulnerabilities, underscoring Perry's potential to enhance various security-focused tasks.",

    "title": "False Claims against Model Ownership Resolution",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Deep neural network (DNN) models are valuable intellectual property of model owners, constituting a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is crucial to develop techniques to protect against model theft. Model ownership resolution (MOR) is a class of techniques that can deter model theft. A MOR scheme enables an accuser to assert an ownership claim for a suspect model by presenting evidence, such as a watermark or fingerprint, to show that the suspect model was stolen or derived from a source model owned by the accuser. Most of the existing MOR schemes prioritize robustness against malicious suspects, ensuring that the accuser will win if the suspect model is indeed a stolen model.In this paper, we show that common MOR schemes in the literature are vulnerable to a different, equally important but insufficiently explored, robustness concern: a malicious accuser. We show how malicious accusers can successfully make false claims against independent suspect models that were not stolen. Our core idea is that a malicious accuser can deviate (without detection) from the specified MOR process by finding (transferable) adversarial examples that successfully serve as evidence against independent suspect models. To this end, we first generalize the procedures of common MOR schemes and show that, under this generalization, defending against false claims is as challenging as preventing (transferable) adversarial examples. Via systematic empirical evaluation we show that our false claim attacks always succeed in MOR schemes that follow our generalization, including in a real-world model: Amazon's Rekognition API.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:LiDAR-based perception is crucial to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous driving (AD) systems. Though some adversarial attack methods against LiDAR-based detectors perception models have been proposed, deceiving such models in the physical world is still challenging. While existing robustness methods focus on transforming point clouds to embed more robust adversarial information, our research reveals how to reduce the errors during the LiDAR capturing process to improve the robustness of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present AE-Morpher, a novel approach that minimizes differences between the LiDAR-captured and original adversarial point clouds to improve the robustness of adversarial objects. It reconstructs the adversarial object using surfaces with regular shapes to fit the discrete laser beams. We evaluate AE-Morpher by conducting physical disappearance attacks that use a mounted adversarial ornament to conceal a car from models' detection results in both SVL Simulator environments and real-world LiDAR setups. In the simulated world, we successfully deceive the model up to 91.1% of the time when LiDAR moves towards the target vehicle from 20m away. On average, our method increases the ASR by 38.64% and reduces the adversarial ornament's projection area by 67.59%. For the real world, we achieve an average attack success rate of 71.4% over a 12m motion scenario. Moreover, adversarial objects reconstructed by our method can be easily physically constructed by human hands without the requirement of a 3D printer.",

    "title": "Learning with Semantics: Towards a Semantics-Aware Routing Anomaly Detection System",
    "abstract": "Abstract:BGP is the de facto inter-domain routing protocol to ensure global connectivity of the Internet. However, various reasons, such as deliberate attacks or misconfigurations, could cause BGP routing anomalies. Traditional methods for BGP routing anomaly detection require significant manual investigation of routes by network operators. Although machine learning has been applied to automate the process, prior arts typically impose significant training overhead (such as large-scale data labeling and feature crafting), and only produce uninterpretable results. To address these limitations, this paper presents a routing anomaly detection system centering around a novel network representation learning model named BEAM. The core design of BEAM is to accurately learn the unique properties (defined as routing role) of each Autonomous System (AS) in the Internet by incorporating BGP semantics. As a result, routing anomaly detection, given BEAM, is reduced to a matter of discovering unexpected routing role churns upon observing new route announcements. We implement a prototype of our routing anomaly detection system and extensively evaluate its performance. The experimental results, based on 18 real-world RouteViews datasets containing over 11 billion route announcement records, demonstrate that our system can detect all previously-confirmed routing anomalies, while only introducing at most five false alarms every 180 million route announcements. We also deploy our system at a large ISP to perform real-world detection for one month. During the course of deployment, our system detects 497 true anomalies in the wild with an average of only 1.65 false alarms per day.",

    "title": "Don't Waste My Efforts: Pruning Redundant Sanitizer Checks by Developer-Implemented Type Checks",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Type confusion occurs when C or C++ code accesses an object after casting it to an incompatible type. The security impacts of type confusion vulnerabilities are significant, potentially leading to system crashes or even arbitrary code execution. To mitigate these security threats, both static and dynamic approaches have been developed to detect type confusion bugs. However, static approaches can suffer from excessive false positives, while existing dynamic approaches track type information for each object to enable safety checking at each cast, introducing a high runtime overhead.In this paper, we present a novel tool T-PRUNIFY to reduce the overhead of dynamic type confusion sanitizers. We observe that in large complex C++ projects, to prevent type confusion bugs, developers often add their own encoding of runtime type information (RTTI) into classes, to enable efficient runtime type checks before casts. T-PRUNIFY works by first identifying these custom RTTI in classes, automatically determining the relationship between field and method return values and the concrete types of corresponding objects. Based on these custom RTTI, T-PRUNIFY can identify cases where a cast is protected by developer-written type checks that guarantee the safety of the cast. Consequently, it can safely remove sanitizer instrumentation for such casts, reducing performance overhead. We evaluate T-PRUNIFY based on HexType, a state-of-the-art type confusion sanitizer that supports extensive C++ projects such as Google Chrome. Our findings demonstrate that our method significantly lowers HexType's average overhead by 25% to 75% in large C++ programs, marking a substantial enhancement in performance.",

TrustZone-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) facilitate security-sensitive tasks like user authentication, disk encryption, and digital rights management (DRM). As such, bugs in the TEE software stack may compromise the entire system's integrity.EL3XIR introduces a framework to effectively rehost and fuzz the secure monitor firmware layer of proprietary TrustZone-based TEEs. While other approaches have focused on naively rehosting or fuzzing Trusted Applications (EL0) or the TEE OS (EL1), EL3XIR targets the highly-privileged but unexplored secure monitor (EL3) and its unique challenges. Secure monitors expose complex functionality dependent on multiple peripherals through diverse secure monitor calls.In our evaluation, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches are insufficient to effectively fuzz COTS secure monitors. While naive fuzzing appears to achieve reasonable coverage it fails to overcome coverage walls due to missing peripheral emulation and is limited in the capability to trigger bugs due to the large input space and low quality of inputs. We followed responsible disclosure procedures and reported a total of 34 bugs, out of which 17 were classified as security critical. Affected vendors confirmed 14 of these bugs, and as a result, EL3XIR was assigned six CVEs.",

Although the video content is displayed inside the HMD without any external exposure, we observe that user head movements are driven by the video content, which creates a unique side channel that does not exist in traditional 2D videos. By recording the user whose vision is blocked by the HMD via a malicious camera, an attacker can analyze the correlation between the user's head movements and the victim video to infer the video title.To exploit this new vulnerability, we present INTRUDE, a system for identifying 360° videos from recordings of user head movements. INTRUDE is empowered by an HMD-based head movement estimation scheme to extract a head movement trace from the recording and a video saliency-based trace-fingerprint matching framework to infer the video title. Evaluation results show that INTRUDE achieves over 96% of accuracy for video identification and is robust under different recording environments. Moreover, INTRUDE maintains its effectiveness in the open-world identification scenario.",

Guided by how users perceive UIs and the features they prioritize, we design a novel grid-based UI representation to capture UI visual appearance while maintaining robustness against evasion. We develop an approach, UIHash, to detect similar Android UIs by comparing their visual appearance. It divides the UI into a #-shaped grid and abstracts UI controls across screen regions, then calculates UI similarity through a neural network architecture that includes a convolutional neural network and a Siamese network. Our evaluation shows that UIHash achieves an F1-score of 0.984 in detection, outperforming existing tree-based methods and image-based methods. Moreover, we have discovered evasion techniques that circumvent existing detection approaches.",

    "title": "MultiFuzz: A Multi-Stream Fuzzer For Testing Monolithic Firmware",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Rapid embedded device proliferation is creating new targets and opportunities for adversaries. However, the complex interactions between firmware and hardware pose challenges to applying automated testing, such as fuzzing. State-of-the-art methods re-host firmware in emulators and facilitate complex interactions with hardware by provisioning for inputs from a diversity of methods (such as interrupts) from a plethora of devices (such as modems). We recognize a significant disconnect between how a fuzzer generates inputs (as a monolithic file) and how the inputs are consumed during re-hosted execution (as a stream, in slices, per peripheral). We demonstrate the disconnect to significantly impact a fuzzer's effectiveness at discovering inputs that explore deeper code and bugs.We rethink the input generation process for fuzzing monolithic firmware and propose a new approach—multi-stream input generation and representation; inputs are now a collection of independent streams, one for each peripheral. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach by implementing: i) stream specific mutation strategies; ii) efficient methods for generating useful values for peripherals; iii) enhancing the use of information learned during fuzzing; and iv) improving a fuzzer's ability to handle roadblocks. We design and build a new fuzzer, MULTIFUZZ, for testing monolithic firmware and evaluate our approach on synthetic and real-world targets. MULTIFUZZ passes all 66 unit tests from a benchmark consisting of 46 synthetic binaries targeting a diverse set of microcontrollers. On an evaluation with 23 real-world firmware targets, MULTIFUZZ outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers Fuzzware and Ember-IO. MULTIFUZZ reaches significantly more code on 14 out of the 23 firmware targets and similar coverage on the remainder. Further, MULTIFUZZ discovered 18 new bugs on real-world targets, many thoroughly tested by previous fuzzers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Key Transparency (KT) refers to a public key distribution system with transparency mechanisms proving its correct operation, i.e., proving that it reports consistent values for each user's public key. While prior work on KT systems have offered new designs to tackle this problem, relatively little attention has been paid on the issue of scalability. Indeed, it is not straightforward to actually build a scalable and practical KT system from existing constructions, which may be too complex, inefficient, or non-resilient against machine failures.In this paper, we present OPTIKS, a full featured and optimized KT system that focuses on scalability. Our system is simpler and more performant than prior work, supporting smaller storage overhead while still meeting strong notions of security and privacy. Our design also incorporates a crash-tolerant and scalable server architecture, which we demonstrate by presenting extensive benchmarks. Finally, we address several real-world problems in deploying KT systems that have received limited attention in prior work, including account decommissioning and user-to-device mapping.",

    "title": "Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attacks in Federated Learning: An Information Theory Approach",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Federated Learning (FL) trains a black-box and high-dimensional model among different clients by exchanging parameters instead of direct data sharing, which mitigates the privacy leak incurred by machine learning. However, FL still suffers from membership inference attacks (MIA) or data reconstruction attacks (DRA). In particular, an attacker can extract the information from local datasets by constructing DRA, which cannot be effectively throttled by existing techniques, e.g., Differential Privacy (DP).In this paper, we aim to ensure a strong privacy guarantee for FL under DRA. We prove that econstruction errors under DRA are constrained by the information acquired by an attacker, which means that constraining the transmitted information can effectively throttle DRA. To quantify the information leakage incurred by FL, we establish a channel model, which depends on the upper bound of joint mutual information between the local dataset and multiple transmitted parameters. Moreover, the channel model indicates that the transmitted information can be constrained through data space operation, which can improve training efficiency and the model accuracy under constrained information. According to the channel model, we propose algorithms to constrain the information transmitted in a single round of local training. With a limited number of training rounds, the algorithms ensure that the total amount of transmitted information is limited. Furthermore, our channel model can be applied to various privacy-enhancing techniques (such as DP) to enhance privacy guarantees against DRA. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Internet-wide scanning is a critical tool for security researchers and practitioners alike. By exhaustively exploring the entire IPv4 address space, Internet scanning has driven the development of new security protocols, found and tracked vulnerabilities, improved DDoS defenses, and illuminated global censorship. Unfortunately, the vast scale of the IPv6 address space—340 trillion trillion trillion addresses—precludes exhaustive scanning, necessitating entirely new IPv6-specific scanning methods. As IPv6 adoption continues to grow, developing IPv6 scanning methods is vital for maintaining our capability to comprehensively investigate Internet security.We present 6SENSE, an end-to-end Internet-wide IPv6 scanning system. 6SENSE utilizes reinforcement learning coupled with an online scanner to iteratively reduce the space of possible IPv6 addresses into a tractable scannable subspace, thus discovering new IPv6 Internet hosts. 6SENSE is driven by a set of metrics we identify and define as key for evaluating the generality, diversity, and correctness of IPv6 scanning. We evaluate 6SENSE and prior generative IPv6 discovery methods across these metrics, showing that 6SENSE is able to identify tens of millions of IPv6 hosts, which compared to prior approaches, is up to 3.6x more hosts and 4x more end-site assignments, across a more diverse set of networks. From our analysis, we identify limitations in prior generative approaches that preclude their use for Internet-scale security scans. We also conduct the first Internet-wide scanning-driven security analysis of IPv6 hosts, focusing on TLS certificates unique to IPv6, surveying open ports and security-sensitive services, and identifying potential CVEs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:In contrast to high-end computing platforms, specialized memory protection features in low-end embedded devices remain relatively unexplored despite the ubiquity of these devices. Hence, we perform an in-depth security evaluation of the state-of-the-art Intellectual Property Encapsulation (IPE) technology found in widely used off-the-shelf, Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontrollers. While we find IPE to be promising, bearing remarkable similarities with trusted execution environments (TEEs) from research and industry, we reveal several fundamental protection shortcomings in current IPE hardware. We show that many software-level attack techniques from the academic TEE literature apply to this platform, and we discover a novel attack primitive, dubbedcontrolledcallcorruption, exploiting a vulnerability in the IPE access control mechanism. Our practical, end-to-end attack scenarios demonstrate a complete bypass of confidentiality and integrity guarantees of IPE-protected programs.Informed by our systematic attack study on IPE and root-cause analysis, also considering related research prototypes, we propose lightweight hardware changes to secure IPE. Furthermore, we develop a prototype framework that transparently implements software responsibilities to reduce information leakage and repurposes the onboard memory protection unit to reinstate IPE security guarantees on currently vulnerable devices with low performance overheads.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:A type of traffic analysis, website fingerprinting (WFP), aims to reveal the website a user visits over an encrypted and anonymized connection by observing and analyzing data flow patterns. Its efficiency against anonymization networks such as Tor has been widely studied, resulting in methods that have steadily increased in both complexity and power. While modern WFP attacks have proven to be highly accurate in laboratory settings, their real-world feasibility is highly debated. These attacks also exclude valuable information by ignoring typical user browsing behavior: users often visit multiple pages of a single website sequentially, e.g., by following links.In this paper, we aim to provide a more realistic assessment of the degree to which Tor users are exposed to WFP. We propose both a novel WFP attack and efficient strategies for adapting existing methods to account for sequential visits of pages within a website. While existing WFP attacks fail to detect almost any website in real-world settings, our novel methods achieve F1-scores of 1.0 for more than half of the target websites. Our attacks remain robust against state-of-the-art WFP defenses, achieving 2.5 to 5 times the accuracy of prior work, and in some cases even rendering the defenses useless. Our methods enable to estimate and to communicate to the user the risk of successive page visits within a website (even in the presence of noise pages) to stop before the WFP attack reaches a critical level of confidence.",

Using social authentication, chat partners authenticate their peers using digital identities managed by identity providers. In this paper, we formally define social authentication, present a protocol called SOAP that largely automates social authentication, formally prove SOAP's security, and demonstrate SOAP's practicality in two prototypes. One prototype is web-based, and the other is implemented in the open-source Signal messaging application.Using SOAP, users can significantly raise the bar for compromising their messaging accounts. In contrast to the default security provided by messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp, attackers must compromise both the messaging account and all identity provider-managed identities to attack a victim. In addition to its security and automation, SOAP is straightforward to adopt as it is built on top of the well-established OpenID Connect protocol.",

    "title": "PointerGuess: Targeted Password Guessing Model Using Pointer Mechanism",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Most existing targeted password guessing models view users' reuse behaviors as sequences of edit operations (e.g., insert and delete) performed on old passwords. These atomic edit operations are limited to modifying one character at a time and cannot fully cover users' complex password modification behaviors (e.g., modifying the password structure). This partially leads to a significant gap between the proportion of users' reused passwords and the success rates that existing targeted password models can achieve. To fill this gap, this paper models users' reuse behaviors by focusing on two key components: (1) What they want to copy/keep; (2) What they want to tweak. More specifically, we introduce the pointer mechanism and propose a new targeted guessing model, namely PointerGuess. By hierarchically redefining password reuse from both personal and population-wide perspectives, we can accurately and comprehensively characterize users' password reuse behaviors. Moreover, we propose MS-PointerGuess, which can employ the victim's multiple leaked passwords.By employing 13 large-scale real-world password datasets, we demonstrate that PointerGuess is effective: (1) When the victim's password at site A (namely pwA) is known, within 100 guesses, the average success rate of PointerGuess in guessing her password at site B (namely pwB, pwA ≠ pwB) is 25.21% (for common users) and 12.34% (for security-savvy users), respectively, which is 21.23%~71.54% (38.37% on average) higher than its foremost counterparts; (2) When not excluding identical password pairs (i.e., pwA can equal pwB), within 100 guesses, the average success rate of PointerGuess is 48.30% (for common users) and 28.42% (for security-savvy users), respectively, which is 6.31%~15.92% higher than its foremost counterparts; (3) Within 100 guesses, the MS-PointerGuess further improves the cracking success rate by 31.21% compared to PointerGuess.",

    "title": "MetaSafe: Compiling for Protecting Smart Pointer Metadata to Ensure Safe Rust Integrity",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Rust is a programming language designed with a focus on memory safety. It introduces new concepts such as ownership and performs static bounds checks at compile time to ensure spatial and temporal memory safety. For memory operations or data types whose safety the compiler cannot prove at compile time, Rust either explicitly excludes such portions of the program, termed unsafe Rust, from static analysis, or it relies on runtime enforcement using smart pointers. Existing studies have shown that potential memory safety bugs in such unsafe Rust can bring down the entire program, proposing in-process isolation or compartmentalization as a remedy. However, in this study, we show that the safe Rust remains susceptible to memory safety bugs even with the proposed isolation applied. The smart pointers upon which safe Rust's memory safety is built rely on metadata often stored alongside program data, possibly within reach of attackers. Manipulating this metadata, an attacker can nullify safe Rust's memory safety checks dependent on it, causing memory access bugs and exploitation. In response to this issue, we propose MetaSafe, a mechanism that safeguards smart pointer metadata from such attacks. MetaSafe stores smart pointer metadata in a gated memory region where only a predefined set of metadata management functions can write, ensuring that each smart pointer update does not cause safe Rust's memory safety violation. We have implemented MetaSafe by extending the official Rust compiler and evaluated it with a variety of micro- and application benchmarks. The overhead of MetaSafe is found to be low; it incurs a 3.5% average overhead on the execution time of a web browser benchmarks.The overhead of MetaSafe is found to be low; it incurs a 3.5% average overhead on the execution time of a web browser benchmarks.",

A SNARK protocol can only be widely accepted as secure, however, if a rigorous proof of its security properties has been vetted by the community. Even then, it is sometimes the case that these security proofs are flawed, and it is then necessary for further research to identify these flaws and correct the record.To increase the rigor of these proofs, we create a formal framework in the Lean theorem prover for representing a widespread subclass of SNARKs based on linear PCPs. We then describe a decision procedure for checking the soundness of SNARKs in this class. We program this procedure and use it to formalize the soundness proof of several different SNARK constructions, including the well-known Groth '16.",

However, no study so far has looked into the user preferences and underlying reasons for switching among VPN providers and identified features that presumably enhance users' VPN experience. This work aims to bridge this gap and shed light on the underlying factors that drive existing users when they switch from one VPN to another. In this work, we analyzed over 1.3 million reviews from 20 leading VPN apps, identifying 1,305 explicit mentions and intents to switch. Our NLP-based analysis unveiled distinct clusters of factors motivating users to switch. An examination of 376 blogs from six popular VPN recommendation sites revealed biases in the content, and we found ignorance towards user preferences.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Object Detection (OD) and Object Tracking (OT) are an important part of autonomous systems (AS), enabling them to perceive and reason about their surroundings. While both OD and OT have been successfully attacked, defenses only exist for OD. In this paper, we introduce VOGUES, which combines perception algorithms in AS with logical reasoning about object components to model human perception. VOGUES leverages pose estimation algorithms to reconstruct the constituent components of objects within a scene, which are then mapped via bipartite matching against OD/OT predictions to detect OT attacks. VOGUES's component reconstruction process is designed such that attacks against OD/OT will not implicitly affect its performance. To prevent adaptive attackers from simultaneously evading OD/OT and component reconstruction, VOGUES integrates an LSTM validator to ensure that the component behavior of objects remains consistent over time. Evaluations in both the physical domain and digital domain yield an average attack detection rate of 96.78% and an FPR of 3.29%. Meanwhile, adaptive attacks against VOGUES require perturbations 30x stronger than previously established in OT attack works, significantly increasing the attack difficulty and reducing their practicality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:In Federated Learning (FL), common privacy-enhancing techniques, such as secure aggregation and distributed differential privacy, rely on the critical assumption ofan honest majorityamong participants to withstand various attacks. In practice, however, servers are not always trusted, and an adversarial server can strategically select compromised clients to create a dishonest majority, thereby undermining the system's security guarantees. In this paper, we present Lotto, an FL system that addresses this fundamental, yet underexplored issue by providing secure participant selection against an adversarial server. Lotto supports two selection algorithms:randomandinformed. To ensure random selection without a trusted server, Lotto enables each client to autonomously determine their participation usingverifiable randomness. For informed selection, which is more vulnerable to manipulation, Lotto approximates the algorithm by employing random selection within arefined client pool. Our theoretical analysis shows that Lotto effectively aligns the proportion of server-selected compromised participants with the base rate of dishonest clients in the population. Large-scale experiments further reveal that Lotto achieves time-to-accuracy performance comparable to that of insecure selection methods, indicating a low computational overhead for secure selection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The SSH protocol provides secure access to network services, particularly remote terminal login and file transfer within organizational networks and to over 15 million servers on the open internet. SSH uses an authenticated key exchange to establish asecure channelbetween a client and a server, which protects the confidentiality and integrity of messages sent in either direction. The secure channel prevents message manipulation, replay, insertion, deletion, and reordering. At the network level, SSH uses theBinary Packet Protocolover TCP.In this paper, we show that as new encryption algorithms and mitigations were added to SSH, the SSH Binary Packet Protocol is no longer a secure channel: SSH channel integrity (INT-PST, aINT-PTXT, and INT-sfCTF) is broken for three widely used encryption modes. This allowsprefix truncationattacks where encrypted packets at the beginning of the SSH channel can be deleted without the client or server noticing it. We demonstrate several real-world applications of this attack. We show that we can fully break SSH extension negotiation (RFC 8308), such that an attacker can downgrade the public key algorithms for user authentication or turn off a new countermeasure against keystroke timing attacks introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. Further, we identify an implementation flaw in AsyncSSH that, together with prefix truncation, allows an attacker to redirect the victim's login into a shell controlled by the attacker.We also performed an internet-wide scan for affected encryption modes and support for extension negotiation. We find that 71.6% of SSH servers support a vulnerable encryption mode, while 63.2% even list it as their preferred choice.We identify two root causes that enable these attacks: First, the SSH handshake supports optional messages that are not authenticated. Second, SSH does not reset message sequence numbers when activating encryption keys. Based on this analysis, we propose effective and backward-compatible changes to SSH that mitigate our attacks.",

Cybersecurity operations centers keep out adversaries and incident response teams clean up after break-ins. Recently a proactive stage has been introduced: Cyber Threat Hunting (TH) looks for potential compromises missed by other cyber defenses. TH is mandated for federal executive agencies and government contractors. As threat hunting is a new cybersecurity discipline, most TH teams operate without a defined process. The practices and challenges of TH have not yet been documented.To address this gap, this paper describes the first interview study of threat hunt practitioners. We obtained access and interviewed 11 threat hunters associated with the U.S. government's Department of Homeland Security. Hour-long interviews were conducted. We analyzed the transcripts with process and thematic coding. We describe the diversity among their processes, show that their processes differ from the TH processes reported in the literature, and unify our subjects' descriptions into a single TH process. We enumerate common TH challenges and solutions according to the subjects. The two most common challenges were difficulty in assessing a Threat Hunter's expertise, and developing and maintaining automation. We conclude with recommendations for TH teams (improve planning, focus on automation, and apprentice new members) and highlight directions for future work (finding a TH process that balances flexibility and formalism, and identifying assessments for TH team performance).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Privacy violations and compliance issues in mobile apps are serious concerns for users, developers, and regulators. With many off-the-shelf tools on Android, prior works extensively studied various privacy issues for Android apps. Privacy risks and compliance issues can be equally expected in iOS apps, but have been little studied. In particular, a prominent recent privacy concern was due to diverse third-party libraries widely integrated into mobile apps whose privacy practices are non-transparent. Such a critical supply chain problem, however, was never systematically studied for iOS apps, at least partially due to the lack of the necessary tools.This paper presents the first large-scale study, based on our new taint analysis system named iHunter, to analyze privacy violations in the iOS software supply chain. iHunter performs static taint analysis on iOS SDKs to extract taint traces representing privacy data collection and leakage practices. It is characterized by an innovative iOS-oriented symbolic execution that tackles dynamic features of Objective-C and Swift and an NLP-powered generator for taint sources and taint rules. iHunter identified non-compliance in 2,585 SDKs (accounting for 40.4%) out of 6,401 iOS SDKs, signifying a substantial presence of SDKs that fail to adhere to compliance standards. We further found a high proportion (47.2% in 32,478) of popular iOS apps using these SDKs, with practical non-compliance risks violating Apple policies and major privacy laws. These results shed light on the pervasiveness and severity of privacy violations in iOS apps' supply chain. iHunter is thoroughly evaluated for its high effectiveness and efficiency. We are responsibly reporting the results to relevant stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Error-handling code is a crucial part of software to ensure stability and security. Failing to handle errors correctly can lead to security vulnerabilities such as DoS, privilege escalation, and data corruption. We propose a novel approach to automatically infer error specifications for system software without a priori domain knowledge, while still achieving a high recall and precision. The key insight behind our approach is that we can identify error-handling paths automatically based on structural similarities between error-handling code. We use the inferred error specification to detect three kinds of bugs: missing error checks, incorrect error checks, and error propagation bugs. Our technique uses a combination of path-sensitive, flow-sensitive and both intra-procedural and inter-procedural data-flow analysis to achieve high accuracy and great scalability. We implemented our technique in a tool called ESSS to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on 7 well-tested, widely-used open-source software projects: OpenSSL, OpenSSH, PHP, zlib, libpng, freetype2, and libwebp. Our tool reported 827 potential bugs in total for all 7 projects combined. We manually categorised these 827 issues into 279 false positives and 541 true positives. Out of these 541 true positives, we sent bug reports and corresponding patches for 46 of them. All the patches were accepted and applied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Threat modeling is considered an essential first step for \"secure by design\" development. Significant prior work and industry efforts have created novel methods for this type of threat modeling, and evaluated them in various simulated settings. Because threat modeling is context-specific, we focused on medical device security experts as regulators require it, and \"secure by design\" medical devices are seen as a critical step to securing healthcare. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with medical device security experts, having participants brainstorm threats and mitigations for two medical devices. We saw these experts do not sequentially work through a list of threats or mitigations according to the rigorous processes described in existing methods and, instead, regularly switch strategies. Our work consists of three major contributions. The first is a two-part process model that describes how security experts 1) determine threats and mitigations for a particular component and 2) move between components. Second, we observed participants leveraging use cases, a strategy not addressed in prior work for threat modeling. Third, we found that integrating safety into threat modeling is critical, albeit unclear. We also provide recommendations for future work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide high availability, speed up content delivery, and safeguard against DDoS attacks for their hosting websites. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, CDN designs several 'back-to-origin' strategies that proactively pre-pull resources and modify HTTP requests and responses. However, our research reveals that these 'back-to-origin' strategies prioritize performance over security, which can lead to excessive consumption of the website's bandwidth.We have proposed a new class of amplification attacks calledBack-to-Origin Amplification (BtOAmp)Attacks. These attacks allow malicious attackers to exploit the 'back-to-origin' strategies, triggering the CDN to greedily demand more-than-necessary resources from websites, which finally blows the websites. We evaluated the feasibility and real-world impacts of 'BtOAmp' attacks on fourteen popular CDNs. With real-world threat evaluation, our attack threatens all mainstream websites hosted on CDNs. We responsibly disclosed the details of our attack to the affected CDN vendors and proposed possible mitigation solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Modern web browsers support rich extension ecosystems that provide users with customized and flexible browsing experiences. Unfortunately, the flexibility of extensions also introduces the potential for abuse, as an extension with sufficient permissions can access and surreptitiously leak sensitive and private browsing data to the extension's authors or third parties. Prior work has explored such extension behavior, but has been limited largely to meta-data about browsing rather than the contents of web pages, and is also based on older versions of browsers, web standards, and APIs, precluding its use for analysis in a modern setting.In this work, we develop Arcanum, a dynamic taint tracking system for modern Chrome extensions designed to monitor the flow of user content from web pages. Arcanum defines a variety of taint sources and sinks, allowing researchers to taint specific parts of pages at runtime via JavaScript, and works on modern extension APIs, JavaScript APIs, and versions of Chromium. We deploy Arcanum to test all functional extensions currently in the Chrome Web Store for the automated exfiltration of user data across seven sensitive websites: Amazon, Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, LinkedIn, Outlook, and PayPal. We observe significant privacy risks across thousands of extensions, including hundreds of extensions automatically extracting user content from within web pages, impacting millions of users. Our findings demonstrate the importance of user content within web pages, and the need for stricter privacy controls on extensions.",

    "title": "Loopy Hell(ow): Inﬁnite Traffic Loops at the Application Layer",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks have long been a persistent threat to network infrastructures. Existing attack primitives require attackers tocontinuouslysend traffic, such as in SYN floods, amplification attacks, or application-layer DoS. In contrast, we study the threat of application-layer traffic loops, which are an almost cost-free attack primitive alternative. Such loops exist, e.g., if two servers consider messages sent to each other as malformed and respond with errors that again trigger error messages. Attackers can send asingleIP-spoofed loop trigger packet to initiate aninfiniteloop among two servers. But despite the severity of traffic loops, to the best of our knowledge, they have never been studied in greater detail.In this paper, we thus investigate the threat of application-layer traffic loops. To this end, we propose a systematic approach to identify loops among real servers. Our core idea is to learn the response functions of all servers of a given application-layer protocol, encode this knowledge into a loop graph, and finally, traverse the graph to spot looping server pairs. Using the proposed method, we examined traffic loops among servers running both popular (DNS, NTP, and TFTP) and legacy (Daytime, Time, Active Users, Chargen, QOTD, and Echo) UDP protocols and confirmed the prevalence of traffic loops. In total, we identified approximately 296k servers in IPv4 vulnerable to traffic loops, providing attackers the opportunity to abuse billions of loop pairs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Recently, many works have considered Private Information Retrieval (PIR) with client-preprocessing: In this model a client and a server jointly run a preprocessing phase, after which client queries run in time sublinear in the database size. However, the preprocessing phase is expensive—proportional to λN, where λ is the security parameter (e.g., λ=128).In this paper we propose SinglePass, the first PIR protocol that is concretely optimal with respect to client-preprocessing, requiring exactly asinglelinear pass over the database. Our approach yields a preprocessing speedup ranging from 45× to 100× and a query speedup of up to 20× when compared to previous state-of-the-art schemes (e.g., Checklist, USENIX SECURITY 2021, making preprocessing PIR more attractive for a myriad of use cases that are \"session-based\".In addition to practical preprocessing,SinglePassfeatures constant-time updates (additions/edits). Previously, the best known approach for handling updates in client-preprocessing PIR had complexityOlogN, while also adding a logNfactor to the bandwidth. We implement our update algorithm and show concrete speedups of about 20× over previous state-of-the-art updatable schemes (e.g.,Checklist).",

To facilitate efficient learning and improve scalability, 5GBaseChecker introduces novel hybrid and collaborative learning techniques. 5GBaseChecker then identifies input sequences for which the extracted FSMs provide deviating outputs. Finally, 5GBaseChecker leverages these deviations to efficiently identify the security properties from specifications and use those to triage if the deviations found in 5G basebands violate any properties.

    "abstract": "Abstract:With the growing popularity of modularity in software development comes the rise of package managers and language ecosystems. Among them, npm stands out as the most extensive package manager, hosting more than 2 million third-party open-source packages that greatly simplify the process of building code. However, this openness also brings security risks, as evidenced by numerous package poisoning incidents.In this paper, we synchronize a local package cache containing more than 3.4 million packages in near real-time to give us access to more package code details. Further, we perform manual inspection and API call sequence analysis on packages collected from public datasets and security reports to build a hierarchical classification framework and behavioral knowledge base covering different sensitive behaviors. In addition, we propose the DONAPI, an automatic malicious npm packages detector that combines static and dynamic analysis. It makes preliminary judgments on the degree of maliciousness of packages by code reconstruction techniques and static analysis, extracts dynamic API call sequences to confirm and identify obfuscated content that static analysis can not handle alone, and finally tags malicious software packages based on the constructed behavior knowledge base. To date, we have identified and manually confirmed 325 malicious samples and discovered 2 unusual API calls and 246 API call sequences that have not appeared in known samples.",

    "title": "VibSpeech: Exploring Practical Wideband Eavesdropping via Bandlimited Signal of Vibration-based Side Channel",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Vibration-based side channel is an ever-present threat to speech privacy. However, due to the target's frequency response with a rapid decay or limited sampling rate of malicious sensors, the acquired vibration signals are often distorted and narrowband, which fails an intelligible speech recovery. This paper tries to answer that when the side-channel data has only a very limited bandwidth (<500Hz), is it feasible to achieve a wideband eavesdropping based on a practical assumption? Our answer is YES based on the assumption that a short utterance (2s-4s) of the victim is exposed to the attacker. What is most surprising is that the attack can recover speech with a bandwidth of up to 8kHz. This covers almost all phonemes (voiced and unvoiced) in human speech and causes practical threat. The core idea of the attack is using vocal-tract features extracted from the victim's utterance to compensate for the side-channel data. To demonstrate the threat, we proposed a vocal-guided attack scheme called VibSpeech and built a prototype based on a mmWave sensor to penetrate soundproof walls for vibration sensing. We solved challenges of vibration artifact suppression and a generalized scheme free of any target's training data. We evaluated VibSpeech with extensive experiments and validated it on the IMU-based method. The results indicated that VibSpeech can recover intelligible speech with an average MCD/SNR of 3.9/5.4dB.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Security awareness campaigns in organizations now collectively cost billions of dollars annually. There is increasing focus on ensuring certain security behaviors among employees. On the surface, this would imply a user-centered view of security in organizations. Despite this, the basis of what security awareness managers do and what decides this are unclear. We conducted n=15 semi-structured interviews with full-time security awareness managers, with experience across various national and international companies in European countries, with thousands of employees. Through thematic analysis, we identify that success in awareness management is fragile while having the potential to improve; there are a range of restrictions, and mismatched drivers and goals for security awareness, affecting how it is structured, delivered, measured, and improved. We find that security awareness as a practice is underspecified, and split between messaging around secure behaviors and connecting to employees, with a lack of recognition for the measures that awareness managers regard as important. We discuss ways forward, including alternative indicators of success, and security usability advocacy for employees.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:State-of-the-art defenses against adversarial patch attacks can now achieve strong certifiable robustness with a marginal drop in model utility. However, this impressive performance typically comes at the cost of 10-100x more inference-time computation compared to undefended models — the research community has witnessed an intense three-way trade-off between certifiable robustness, model utility, and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a defense framework named PatchCURE to approach this trade-off problem. PatchCURE provides sufficient \"knobs\" for tuning defense performance and allows us to build a family of defenses: the most robust PatchCURE instance can match the performance of any existing state-of-the-art defense (without efficiency considerations); the most efficient PatchCURE instance has similar inference efficiency as undefended models. Notably, PatchCURE achieves state-of-the-art robustness and utility performance across all different efficiency levels, e.g., 16-23% absolute clean accuracy and certified robust accuracy advantages over prior defenses when requiring computation efficiency to be close to undefended models. The family of PatchCURE defenses enables us to flexibly choose appropriate defenses to satisfy given computation and/or utility constraints in practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Recent works have identified a gap between research and practice in artificial intelligence security: threats studied in academia do not always reflect the practical use and security risks of AI. For example, while models are often studied in isolation, they form part of larger ML pipelines in practice. Recent works also brought forward that adversarial manipulations introduced by academic attacks are impractical. We take a first step towards describing the full extent of this disparity. To this end, we revisit the threat models of the six most studied attacks in AI security research and match them to AI usage in practice via a survey with 271 industrial practitioners. On the one hand, we find that all existing threat models are indeed applicable. On the other hand, there are significant mismatches: research is often too generous with the attacker, assuming access to information not frequently available in real-world settings. Our paper is thus a call for action to study more practical threat models in artificial intelligence security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Despite the impressive capabilities of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), these systems remain fault-prone due to unresolved issues of robustness to perturbations and concept drift. Existing approaches to interpreting faults often provide only low-level abstractions, while struggling to extract meaningful concepts to understand the root cause. Furthermore, these prior methods lack integration and generalization across multiple types of faults. To address these limitations, we present a fault diagnosis tool (akin to a General Practitioner) DNN-GP, an integrated interpreter designed to diagnose various types of model faults through the interpretation of latent concepts. DNN-GP incorporates probing samples derived from adversarial attacks, semantic attacks, and samples exhibiting drifting issues to provide a comprehensible interpretation of a model's erroneous decisions. Armed with an awareness of the faults, DNN-GP derives countermeasures from the concept space to bolster the model's resilience. DNN-GP is trained once on a dataset and can be transferred to provide versatile, unsupervised diagnoses for other models, and is sufficiently general to effectively mitigate unseen attacks. DNN-GP is evaluated on three real-world datasets covering both attack and drift scenarios to demonstrate state-to the-art detection accuracy (near 100%) with low false positive rates (<5%).",

Studies on parental content sharing have investigated perceptions of parents and children, leaving out those of young adults between the ages of 18 and 30. We addressed this gap via a questionnaire asking young adults about their perspectives on parental sharing of children's photos on social media. We found that young adults who had content about them shared by their parents during childhood and those who were parents expressed greater acceptance of parental sharing practices in terms of motives, content, and audiences.

Recently fuzzing techniques, traditionally used for detecting software vulnerabilities, have shown promising results for uncovering vulnerabilities in large-scale hardware designs, such as processors. Researchers have adapted black-box or grey-box fuzzing to detect timing vulnerabilities in processors. However, they cannot identify the locations or root causes of these timing vulnerabilities, nor do they provide coverage feedback to enable the designer's confidence in the processor's security.To address the deficiencies of the existing fuzzers, we presentWhisperFuzz—the first white-box fuzzer with static analysis—aiming to detect and locate timing vulnerabilities in processors and evaluate the coverage of microarchitectural timing behaviors.WhisperFuzzuses the fundamental nature of processors' timing behaviors, microarchitectural state transitions, to localize timing vulnerabilities.WhisperFuzzautomatically extractsmicroarchitectural statetransitions from a processor design at the register-transfer level (RTL) and instruments the design to monitor the state transitions as coverage. Moreover,WhisperFuzzmeasures the time a design-under-test (DUT) takes to process tests, identifying any minor, abnormal variations that may hint at a timing vulnerability.WhisperFuzzdetects 12 new timing vulnerabilities across advanced open-sourced RISC-V processors: BOOM, Rocket Core, and CVA6. Eight of these violate the zero latency requirements of the Zkt extension and are considered serious security vulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Existing local differential privacy (LDP) techniques enable untrustworthy aggregators to perform only very simple data mining tasks on distributed private data, including statistical estimation and frequent item mining. There is currently no general LDP method that discovers relations between items. The main challenge lies in the curse of dimensionality, as the quantity of values to be estimated in mining relations is the square of the quantity of values to be estimated in mining item-level knowledge, leading to a considerable decrease in the final estimation accuracy. We propose LDP-RM, the first relation mining method under LDP. It represents items and relations in a matrix and utilizes singular value decomposition and low rank approximation to reduce the number of values to estimate fromO(k2)toO(r), wherekis the number of all considered items, andr < kis a parameter determined by the aggregator, signifying the rank of the approximation. LDP-RM serves as a fundamental privacy-preserving method for enabling various complex data mining tasks.",

To mitigate their occurrence, operating systems rely on synchronization primitives such as mutexes, spinlocks, etc.In this paper, we present GhostRace, the first security analysis of these primitives onspeculatively executedcode paths. Our key finding is thatallthe common synchronization primitives can be microarchitecturally bypassed on speculative paths, turning all architecturally race-free critical regions intoSpeculative Race Conditions (SRCs). To study the severity of SRCs, we focus on Speculative Concurrent Use-After-Free (SCUAF) and uncover 1,283 potentially exploitable gadgets in the Linux kernel. Moreover, we demonstrate that SCUAF information disclosure attacks against the kernel are not only practical, but that their reliability can closely match that of traditional Spectre attacks, with our proof of concept leaking kernel memory at 12 KB/s. Crucially, we develop a new technique to create an unbounded race window, accommodating anarbitrarynumber of SCUAF invocations required by an end-to-end attack in asinglerace window. To address the new attack surface, we also propose a generic SRC mitigation to harden all the affected synchronization primitives on Linux.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Google recently announced plans to phase out third-party cookies and is currently in the process of rolling out the Chrome Privacy Sandbox, a collection of APIs and web standards that offer privacy-preserving alternatives to existing technologies, particularly for the digital advertising ecosystem. This includes FLEDGE, also referred to as the Protected Audience, which provides the necessary mechanisms for effectively conducting real-time bidding and ad auctions directly within users' browsers. FLEDGE is designed to eliminate the invasive data collection and pervasive tracking practices used for remarketing and targeted advertising. In this paper, we provide a study of the FLEDGE ecosystem both before and after its official deployment in Chrome. We find that even though multiple prominent ad platforms have entered the space, Google ran 99.8% of the auctions we observed, highlighting its dominant role. Subsequently, we provide the first in-depth empirical analysis of FLEDGE, and uncover a series of severe design and implementation flaws. We leverage those for conducting 12 novel attacks, including tracking, cross-site leakage, service disruption, and pollution attacks. While FLEDGE aims to enhance user privacy, our research demonstrates that it is currently exposing users to significant risks, and we outline mitigations for addressing the issues that we have uncovered. We have also responsibly disclosed our findings to Google so as to kickstart remediation efforts. We believe that our research highlights the dire need for more in-depth investigations of the entire Privacy Sandbox, due to the massive impact it will have on user privacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Open-source web applications have given everyone the ability to deploy complex web applications on their site(s), ranging from blogs and personal clouds, to server administration tools and webmail clients. Given that there exists millions of deployments of this software in the wild, the ability to fingerprint a particular release of a web application residing at a web endpoint is of interest to both attackers and defenders alike.In this work, we study modern web application fingerprinting techniques and identify their inherent strengths and weaknesses. We design WASABO, a web application testing framework and use it to measure the performance of six web application fingerprinting tools against 1,360 releases of popular web applications. While 94.8% of all web application releases were correctly labeled by at least one fingerprinting tool in ideal conditions, many tools are unable to produce a single version prediction for a particular release. This leads to instances where a release is labeled as multiple disparate versions, resulting in administrator confusion on the security posture of an unknown web application.We also measure the accuracy of each tool against real-world deployments of the studied web applications, observing up to an 80% drop-off in performance compared to our offline results. To identify causes for this performance degradation, as well as to improve the robustness of these tools in the wild, we design a web-application-agnostic middleware which applies a series of transformations to the traffic of each fingerprinting tool. Overall, we are able to improve the performance of popular web application fingerprinting tools by up to 22.9%, without any modification to the evaluated tools.",

    "title": "With Great Power Come Great Side Channels: Statistical Timing Side-Channel Analyses with Bounded Type-1 Errors",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Constant-time implementations are essential to guarantee the security of secret-key operations. According to Jancar et al. [42], most cryptographic developers do not use statistical tests to evaluate their implementations for timing side-channel vulnerabilities. One of the main reasons is their high unreliability due to potential false positives caused by noisy data. In this work, we address this issue and present an improved statistical evaluation methodology with a controlled type-1 error (α) that restricts false positives independently of the noise distribution. Simultaneously, we guarantee statistical power with increasing sample size. With the bounded type-1 error, the user can perform trade-offs between false positives and the size of the side channels they wish to detect. We achieve this by employing an empirical bootstrap that creates a decision rule based on the measured data.We implement this approach in an open-source tool called RTLF and compare it with three different competitors:Mona,dudect, andtlsfuzzer. We further compare our results to the t-test, a commonly used statistical test for side-channel analysis. To show the applicability of our tool in real cryptographic network scenarios, we performed a quantitative analysis with local timing measurements for CBC Padding Oracle attacks, Bleichenbacher's attack, and the Lucky13 attack in 823 available versions of eleven TLS libraries. Additionally, we performed a qualitative analysis of the most recent version ofeach library. We find that most libraries were long-time vulnerable to at least one of the considered attacks, with side channels big enough likely to be exploitable in a LAN setting. Through the qualitative analysis based on the results of RTLF, we identified seven vulnerabilities in recent versions.",

    "title": "A NEW HOPE: Contextual Privacy Policies for Mobile Applications and An Approach Toward Automated Generation",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Privacy policies have emerged as the predominant approach to conveying privacy notices to mobile application users. In an effort to enhance both readability and user engagement, the concept of contextual privacy policies (CPPs) has been proposed by researchers. The aim of CPPs is to fragment privacy policies into concise snippets, displaying them only within the corresponding contexts within the application's graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In this paper, we first formulate CPP in mobile application scenario, and then present a novel multimodal framework, namedSeePrivacy, specifically designed to automatically generate CPPs for mobile applications. This method uniquely integrates vision-based GUI understanding with privacy policy analysis, achieving 0.88 precision and 0.90 recall to detect contexts, as well as 0.98 precision and 0.96 recall in extracting corresponding policy segments. A human evaluation shows that 77% of the extracted privacy policy segments were perceived as well-aligned with the detected contexts. These findings suggest that SeePrivacy could serve as a significant tool for bolstering user interaction with, and understanding of, privacy policies. Furthermore, our solution has the potential to make privacy notices more accessible and inclusive, thus appealing to a broader demographic.

    "title": "GFWeb: Measuring the Great Firewall's Web Censorship at Scale",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Censorship systems such as the Great Firewall (GFW) have been continuously refined to enhance their filtering capabilities. However, most prior studies, and in particular the GFW, have been limited in scope and conducted over short time periods, leading to gaps in our understanding of the GFW's evolving Web censorship mechanisms over time. We introduce GFWeb, a novel system designed to discover domain blocklists used by the GFW for censoring Web access. GFWeb exploits GFW's bidirectional and loss-tolerant blocking behavior to enable testing hundreds of millions of domains on a monthly basis, thereby facilitating large-scale longitudinal measurement of HTTP and HTTPS blocking mechanisms.Over the course of 20 months, GFWeb has tested a total of 1.02 billion domains, and detected 943K and 55K pay-level domains censored by the GFW's HTTP and HTTPS filters, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the most extensive set of domains censored by the GFW ever discovered to date, many of which have never been detected by prior systems. Analyzing the longitudinal dataset collected by GFWeb, we observe that the GFW has been upgraded to mitigate several issues previously identified by the research community, including overblocking and failure in reassembling fragmented packets. More importantly, we discover that the GFW's bidirectional blocking is not symmetric as previously thought, i.e., it can only be triggered by certain domains when probed from inside the country. We discuss the implications of our work on existing censorship measurement and circumvention efforts. We hope insights gained from our study can help inform future research, especially in monitoring censorship and developing new evasion tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The security guarantees of cloud computing depend on the isolation guarantees of the underlying hypervisors. Prior works have presented effective methods for automatically identifying vulnerabilities in hypervisors. However, these approaches are limited in scope. For instance, their implementation is typically hypervisor-specific and limited by requirements for detailed grammars, access to source-code, and assumptions about hypervisor behaviors. In practice, complex closed-source and recent open-source hypervisors are often not suitable for off-the-shelf fuzzing techniques.HYPERPILL introduces a generic approach for fuzzing arbitrary hypervisors. HYPERPILL leverages the insight that although hypervisor implementations are diverse, all hypervisors rely on the identical underlying hardware-virtualization interface to manage virtual-machines. To take advantage of the hardware-virtualization interface, HYPERPILL makes a snapshot of the hypervisor, inspects the snapshotted hardware state to enumerate the hypervisor's input-spaces, and leverages feedback-guided snapshot-fuzzing within an emulated environment to identify vulnerabilities in arbitrary hypervisors. In our evaluation, we found that beyond being the first hypervisor-fuzzer capable of identifying vulnerabilities in arbitrary hypervisors across all major attack-surfaces (i.e., PIO/MMIO/Hypercalls/DMA), HYPERPILL also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that rely on access to source-code, due to the granularity of feedback provided by HYPERPILL's emulation-based approach. In terms of coverage, HYPERPILL outperformed past fuzzers for 10/12 QEMU devices, without the API hooking or source-code instrumentation techniques required by prior works. HYPERPILL identified 26 new bugs in recent versions of QEMU, Hyper-V, and macOS Virtualization Framework across four device-categories",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Virtual Reality (VR) has witnessed a rising issue of harassment, prompting the integration of safety controls like muting and blocking in VR applications. However, the lack of standardized safety measures across VR applications hinders their universal effectiveness, especially across contexts like socializing, gaming, and streaming. While prior research has studied safety controls in social VR applications, our user study (n = 27) takes a multi-perspective approach, examining both users' perceptions of safety control usability and effectiveness as well as the challenges that developers face in designing and deploying VR safety controls. We identify challenges VR users face while employing safety controls, such as finding users in crowded virtual spaces to block them. VR users also find controls ineffective in addressing harassment; for instance, they fail to eliminate the harassers' presence from the environment. Further, VR users find the current methods of submitting evidence for reports time-consuming and cumbersome. Improvements desired by users include live moderation and behavior tracking across VR apps; however, developers cite technological, financial, and legal obstacles to implementing such solutions, often due to a lack of awareness and high development costs. We emphasize the importance of establishing technical and legal guidelines to enhance user safety in virtual environments.",

Schemes based on fastReed–Solomon interactive oracle proofs(RS-IOP) of proximity have recently emerged, offering transparent setup, plausible post-quantum security, efficient operations, and, notably, sublinear proof size and verification. Manifesting a new paradigm, PCS with one-to-many proof can enhance the performance of (asynchronous) verifiable secret sharing ((A)VSS), a cornerstone in distributed computing, for proving multiple evaluations to multiple verifiers. Current RS-IOP-based multivariate PCS, including HyperPlonk (Eurocrypt '23) and Virgo (S&P '20), however, only offer quasi-linear prover complexity in the polynomial size.We propose PolyFRIM, a fast RS-IOP-based multivariate PCS with optimal linear prover complexity, 5-25× faster than prior arts while ensuring competent proof size and verification. Heeding the challenging absence of FFT circuits for multivariate evaluation, PolyFRIM surpasses Zhang et al.'s (Usenix Sec. '22) one-to-many univariate PCS, accelerating proving by 4-7× and verification by 2-4× with 25% shorter proof. Leveraging PolyFRIM, we propose an AVSS scheme FRISS with a better efficiency tradeoff than prior arts from multivariate PCS, including Bingo (Crypto '23) and Haven (FC '21).",

    "title": "Eye of Sauron: Long-Range Hidden Spy Camera Detection and Positioning with Inbuilt Memory EM Radiation",
    "abstract": "Abstract:In this paper, we present ESauron — the first proof-of-concept system that can detect diverse forms of spy cameras (i.e., wireless, wired and offline devices) and quickly pinpoint their locations. The key observation is that, for all spy cameras, the captured raw images must be first digested (e.g., encoding and compression) in the video-capture devices before transferring to target receiver or storage medium. This digestion process takes place in an inbuilt read-write memory whose operations cause electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Specifically, the memory clock drives a variable number of switching voltage regulator activities depending on the workloads, causing fluctuating currents injected into memory units, thus emitting EMR signals at the clock frequency. Whenever the visual scene changes, bursts of video data processing (e.g., video encoding) suddenly aggravate the memory workload, bringing responsive EMR patterns. ESauron can detect spy cameras by intentionally stimulating scene changes and then sensing the surge of EMRs even from a considerable distance. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of the ESauron by carefully designing techniques to sense and differentiate memory EMRs, assert the existence of spy cameras, and pinpoint their locations. Experiments with 50 camera products show that ESauron can detect all spy cameras with an accuracy of 100% after only 4 stimuli, the detection range can exceed 20 meters even in the presence of blockages, and all spy cameras can be accurately located.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Users' growing concerns about online privacy have led to increased platform support for transparency and consent in the web and mobile ecosystems. To that end, Android recently mandated that developers must disclose what user data their applications collect and share, and that information is made available in Google Play's Data Safety section.In this paper, we provide the first large-scale, in-depth investigation on the veracity of the Data Safety section and its use in the Android application ecosystem. We build an automated analysis framework that dynamically exercises and analyzes applications so as to uncover discrepancies between the applications' behavior and the data practices that have been reported in their Data Safety section. Our study on almost 5K applications uncovers a pervasive trend of incomplete disclosure, as 81% misrepresent their data collection and sharing practices in the Data Safety section. At the same time, 79.4% of the applications with incomplete disclosures do not ask the user to provide consent for the data they collect and share, and 78.6% of those that ask for consent disregard the users' choice. Moreover, while embedded third-party libraries are the most common offender, Data Safety discrepancies can be traced back to the application's core code in 41% of the cases. Crucially, Google's documentation contains various \"loopholes\" that facilitate incomplete disclosure of data practices. Overall, we find that in its current form, Android's Data Safety section does not effectively achieve its goal of increasing transparency and allowing users to provide informed consent. We argue that Android's Data Safety policies require considerable reform, and automated validation mechanisms like our framework are crucial for ensuring the correctness and completeness of applications' Data Safety disclosures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:In recent years, there has been a growing focus on scrutinizing the security of cellular networks, often attributing security vulnerabilities to issues in the underlying protocol design descriptions. These protocol design specifications, typically extensive documents that are thousands of pages long, can harbor inaccuracies, underspecifications, implicit assumptions, and internal inconsistencies. In light of the evolving landscape, we introduce CellularLint—a semi-automatic framework for inconsistency detection within the standards of 4G and 5G, capitalizing on a suite of natural language processing techniques. Our proposed method uses a revamped few-shot learning mechanism on domain-adapted large language models. Pre-trained on a vast corpus of cellular network protocols, this method enables CellularLint to simultaneously detect inconsistencies at various levels of semantics and practical use cases. In doing so, CellularLint significantly advances the automated analysis of protocol specifications in a scalable fashion. In our investigation, we focused on the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) and the security specifications of 4G and 5G networks, ultimately uncovering 157 inconsistencies with 82.67% accuracy. After verification of these inconsistencies on open-source implementations and 17 commercial devices, we confirm that they indeed have a substantial impact on design decisions, potentially leading to concerns related to privacy, integrity, availability, and interoperability.",

    "title": "Pixel+ and Pixel++: Compact and Efficient Forward-Secure Multi-Signatures for PoS Blockchain Consensus",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Multi-signature schemes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their popular applications in PoS blockchains. However, the use of general multi-signature schemes poses a critical threat to the security of PoS blockchains once signing keys get corrupted. That is, after an adversary obtains enough signing keys, it can break the immutable nature of PoS blockchains by forking the chain and modifying the history from some point in the past. Forward-secure multi-signature (FS-MS) schemes can overcome this issue by periodically updating signing keys. The only FS-MS construction currently available is Drijvers et al's Pixel, which builds on pairing groups and only achieves forward security at the time period level.In this work, we present new FS-MS constructions that either are free from pairing or capture forward security at the individual message level (i.e., fine-grained forward security). Our first construction Pixel+ works for a maximum number of time periods T. Pixel+ signatures consist of only one group element, and can be verified using two exponentiations. It is the first FS-MS from RSA assumption, and has 3.5x and 22.8x faster signing and verification than Pixel, respectively. Our second FS-MS construction Pixel++ is a pairing-based one. It immediately revokes the signing key's capacity of re-signing the message after creating a signature on this message, rather than at the end of the current time period. Thus, it provides more practical forward security than Pixel. On the other hand, Pixel++ is almost as efficient as Pixel in terms of signing and verification. Both Pixel+ and Pixel++ allow for non-interactive aggregation of signatures from independent signers and are proven to be secure in the random oracle model. In addition, they also support the aggregation of public keys, significantly reducing the storage overhead on PoS blockchains.We demonstrate how to integrate Pixel+ and Pixel++ into PoS blockchains. As a proof-of-concept, we provide implementations of Pixel+ and Pixel++, and conduct several representative experiments to show that Pixel+ and Pixel++ have good concrete efficiency and are practical.",

To obtain these improvements, we combine the use of Newton's identities for mixing with a novel way of exploiting an algebraic structure in the powers of field elements, based on an {\\em additive 2-basis}, to compactly encode and decode client messages. We also introduce a simple and efficient distributed protocol to verify the well-formedness of client input encodings, which should consist of shares of multiple arithmetic progressions tied together.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:We focus on the problem of I/O-efficient Dynamic Searchable Encryption (DSE), i.e., schemes that perform well when executed with the dataset on-disk. Towards this direction, for HDDs, schemes have been proposed with good locality (i.e., low number of performed non-continuous memory reads) and read efficiency (the number of additional memory locations read per result item). Similarly, for SSDs, schemes with good page efficiency (reading as few pages as possible) have been proposed. However, the vast majority of these works are limited to the static case (i.e. no dataset modifications) and the only dynamic scheme fails to achieve forward and backward privacy, the de-facto leakage standard in the literature. In fact, prior related works (Bost [CCS'16] and Minaud and Reichle[CRYPTO'22]) claim that I/O-efficiency and forward-privacy are two irreconcilable notions. Contrary to that, in this work, we \"reconcile\" for the first time forward and backward privacy with I/O-efficiency for DSE both for HDDs and SSDs. We propose two families of DSE constructions which also improve the state-of-the-art (non I/O-efficient) both asymptotically and experimentally. Indeed, some of our schemes improve the in-memory performance of prior works. At a technical level, we revisit and enhance the lazy de-amortization DSE construction by Demertzis et al. [NDSS'20], transforming it into an I/O-preserving one. Importantly, we introduce an oblivious-merge protocol that merges two equal-sized databases without revealing any information, effectively replacing the costly oblivious data structures with more lightweight computations.",

    "title": "FaceObfuscator: Defending Deep Learning-based Privacy Attacks with Gradient Descent-resistant Features in Face Recognition",
    "abstract": "Abstract:As face recognition is widely used in various security-sensitive scenarios, face privacy issues are receiving increasing attention. Recently, many face recognition works have focused on privacy preservation and converted the original images into protected facial features. However, our study reveals that emerging Deep Learning-based (DL-based) reconstruction attacks exhibit notable ability in learning and removing the protection patterns introduced by existing schemes and recovering the original facial images, thus posing a significant threat to face privacy. To address this threat, we introduce FaceObfuscator, a lightweight privacy-preserving face recognition system that first removes visual information that is non-crucial for face recognition from facial images via frequency domain and then generates obfuscated features interleaved in the feature space to resist gradient descent in DL-based reconstruction attacks. To minimize the loss in face recognition accuracy, obfuscated features with different identities are well-designed to be interleaved but non-duplicated in the feature space. This non-duplication ensures that FaceObfuscator can extract identity information from the obfuscated features for accurate face recognition. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FaceObfuscator's privacy protection capability improves around 90% compared to existing privacy-preserving methods in two major leakage scenarios including channel leakage and database leakage, with a negligible 0.3% loss in face recognition accuracy. Our approach has also been evaluated in a real-world environment and protected more than 100K people's face data of a major university.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Warning users about suspicious emails usually happens through visual interventions such as banners. Evidence from laboratory experiments shows that email banner warnings are unsuitable for blind and low-vision (BLV) users as they tend to miss or make no use of them. However, the laboratory settings preclude a full understanding of how BLV users would realistically behave around these banner warnings because the experiments don't use the individuals' own email addresses, devices, or emails of their choice. To address this limitation, we devised a study with n=21 BLV email users in realistic settings. Our findings indicate that this user population misses or makes no use of Gmail and Outlook banner warnings because these are implemented in a \"narrow\" sense, that is, (i) they allow access to the warning text without providing context relevant to the risk of associated email, and (ii) the formatting, together with the possible actions, is confusing as to how a user should deal with the email in question. To address these barriers, our participants proposed designs to accommodate the accessibility preferences and usability habits of individuals with visual disabilities according to their capabilities to engage with email banner warnings.",

    "title": "When Threads Meet Interrupts: Effective Static Detection of Interrupt-Based Deadlocks in Linux",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Deadlocking is an unresponsive state of software that arises when threads hold locks while trying to acquire other locks that are already held by other threads, resulting in a circular lock dependency. Interrupt-based deadlocks, a specific and prevalent type of deadlocks that occur within the OS kernel due to interrupt preemption, pose significant risks to system functionality, performance, and security. However, existing static analysis tools focus on resource-based deadlocks without characterizing the interrupt preemption. In this paper, we introduce Archerfish, the first static analysis approach for effectively identifying interrupt-based deadlocks in the large-scale Linux kernel. At its core, Archerfish utilizes an Interrupt-Aware Lock Graph (ILG) to capture both regular and interrupt-related lock dependencies, reducing the deadlock detection problem to graph cycle discovery and refinement. Furthermore, Archerfish incorporates four effective analysis components to construct ILG and refine the deadlock cycles, addressing three core challenges, including the extensive interrupt-involving concurrency space, identifying potential interrupt handlers, and validating the feasibility of deadlock cycles. Our experimental results show that Archerfish can precisely analyze the Linux kernel (19.8 MLoC) in approximately one hour. At the time of writing, we have discovered 76 previously unknown deadlocks, with 53 bugs confirmed, 46 bugs already fixed by the Linux community, and 2 CVE IDs assigned. Notably, those found deadlocks are long-latent, hiding for an average of 9.9 years.",

    "title": "DPAdapter: Improving Differentially Private Deep Learning through Noise Tolerance Pre-training",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Recent developments have underscored the critical role of differential privacy (DP) in safeguarding individual data for training machine learning models. However, integrating DP oftentimes incurs significant model performance degradation due to the perturbation introduced into the training process, presenting a formidable challenge in the differentially private machine learning (DPML) field. To this end, several mitigative efforts have been proposed, typically revolving around formulating new DPML algorithms or relaxing DP definitions to harmonize with distinct contexts. In spite of these initiatives, the diminishment induced by DP on models, particularly large-scale models, remains substantial and thus, necessitates an innovative solution that adeptly circumnavigates the consequential impairment of model utility.In response, we introduce DPAdapter, a pioneering technique designed to amplify the model performance of DPML algorithms by enhancing parameter robustness. The fundamental intuition behind this strategy is that models with robust parameters are inherently more resistant to the noise introduced by DP, thereby retaining better performance despite the perturbations. DPAdapter modifies and enhances the sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) technique, utilizing a two-batch strategy to provide a more accurate perturbation estimate and an efficient gradient descent, thereby improving parameter robustness against noise. Notably, DPAdapter can act as a plug-and-play component and be combined with existing DPML algorithms to further improve their performance. Our experiments show that DPAdapter vastly enhances state-of-the-art DPML algorithms, increasing average accuracy from 72.92% to 77.09% with a privacy budget of ϵ = 4.",

In particular, we investigate the feasibility to inject malicious wireless signals from a transmitter on the ground in order to compromise and manipulate the control of close-by satellite terminals. Based on a case study with a widely used commercial modem device, we find that VSATs are not designed to withstand simple signal injection attacks. The modems assume that any received signal comes from a legitimate satellite. We show that an attacker equipped with a low-cost software-defined radio (SDR) can inject arbitrary IP traffic into the internal network of the terminal. We explore different attacks that aim to deny service, manipulate the modem's firmware, or gain a remote admin shell. Further, we quantify their probability of success depending on the wireless channel conditions and the placement of the attacker versus the angle of arrival of the signal at the antenna dish of the receiver.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The IETF released RFC 8446 in 2018 as the new TLS 1.3 standard, which recommends using X25519 for key exchange and Ed25519 for identity verification. These computations are the most time-consuming steps in the TLS handshake. Intel introduced AVX-512 in 2013 as an extension of AVX2, and in 2018, AVX-512IFMA, a submodule of AVX-512 to further support 52-bit (integer) multipliers, was implemented on Cannon Lake CPUs.This paper first revisits various optimization strategies for ECC and presents a more performant X25519/Ed25519 implementation using the AVX-512IFMA instructions. These optimization strategies cover all levels of ECC arithmetic, including finite field arithmetic, point arithmetic, and scalar multiplication computations. Furthermore, we formally verify our finite field implementation to ensure its correctness and robustness.In addition to the cryptographic implementation, we further explore the deployment of our optimized X25519/Ed25519 library in the TLS protocol layer and the TLS ecosystem. To this end, we design and implement an OpenSSL ENGINE called ENG25519, which propagates the performance benefits of our ECC library to the TLS protocol layer and the TLS ecosystem. The TLS applications can benefit directly from the underlying cryptographic improvements through ENG25519 without necessitating any changes to the source code of OpenSSL and applications. Moreover, we discover that the cold-start issue of vector units degrades the performance of cryptography in TLS protocol, and we develop an auxiliary thread with a heuristic warm-up scheme to mitigate this issue.Finally, this paper reports a successful integration of the ENG25519 into an unmodified DNS over TLS (DoT) server called unbound, which further highlights the practicality of the ENG25519. We also report benchmarks of TLS 1.3 handshake and DoT query, achieving a speedup of 25% to 35% for TLS 1.3 handshakes per second and an improvement of 24% to 41% for the peak server throughput of DoT queries.",

    "title": "ZKSMT: A VM for Proving SMT Theorems in Zero Knowledge",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Verification of program safety is often reducible to proving the unsatisfiability (i.e., validity) of a formula in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT): Boolean logic combined with theories that formalize arbitrary first-order fragments. Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs allow SMT formulas to be validated without revealing the underlying formulas or their proofs to other parties, which is a crucial building block for proving the safety of proprietary programs. Recently, Luo et al. (CCS 2022) studied the simpler problem of proving the unsatisfiability of pure Boolean formulas but does not support proofs generated by SMT solvers. This work presents ZKSMT, a novel framework for proving the validity of SMT formulas in ZK. We design a virtual machine (VM) tailored to efficiently represent the verification process of SMT validity proofs in ZK. Our VM can support the vast majority of popular theories when proving program safety while being complete and sound. To demonstrate this, we instantiate the commonly used theories of equality and linear integer arithmetic in our VM with theory-specific optimizations for proving them in ZK. ZKSMT achieves high practicality even when running on realistic SMT formulas generated by Boogie, a common tool for software verification. It achieves a three-order-of-magnitude improvement compared to a baseline that executes the proof verification code in a general ZK system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Recovery codes are a popular backup mechanism for online services to aid users who lost their passwords or two-factor authentication tokens in regaining access to their accounts or encrypted data. Especially for end-to-end encrypted services, recovery codes are a critical feature, as the service itself cannot access the encrypted user data and help users regain access. The way end-users manage recovery codes is not well understood. Hence, we investigate end-user perceptions and management strategies of recovery codes. Therefore, we survey users of an end-to-end encrypted email service provider, deploying recovery codes for accounts and encrypted data recovery in case of authentication credential loss. We performed an online survey with 281 users. In a second study, we analyzed 197 support requests on Reddit. Most of our participants stored the service provider's recovery code. We could identify six strategies for saving it, with using a password manager being the most widespread. Participants were generally satisfied with the service provider's recovery code. However, while they appreciated its security, its usability was lacking. We found obstacles, such as losing access to the recovery code or non-functioning recovery codes and security misconceptions. These often resulted from users not understanding the underlying security implications, e.g., that the support cannot access or restore their unencrypted data.",

    "title": "In Wallet We Trust: Bypassing the Digital Wallets Payment Security for Free Shopping",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Digital wallets are a new form of payment technology that provides a secure and convenient way of making contactless payments through smart devices. In this paper, we study the security of financial transactions made through digital wallets, focusing on the authentication, authorization, and access control security functions. We find that the digital payment ecosystem supports the decentralized authority delegation which is susceptible to a number of attacks. First, an attacker adds the victim's bank card into their (attacker's) wallet by exploiting the authentication method agreement procedure between the wallet and the bank. Second, they exploit the unconditional trust between the wallet and the bank, and bypass the payment authorization. Third, they create a trap door through different payment types and violate the access control policy for the payments. The implications of these attacks are of a serious nature where the attacker can make purchases of arbitrary amounts by using the victim's bank card, despite these cards being locked and reported to the bank as stolen by the victim. We validate these findings in practice over major US banks (notably Chase, AMEX, Bank of America, and others) and three digital wallet apps (ApplePay, GPay, and PayPal). We have disclosed our findings to all the concerned parties. Finally, we propose remedies for fixing the design flaws to avoid these and other similar attacks.",

    "title": "Abuse Reporting for Metadata-Hiding Communication Based on Secret Sharing",
    "abstract": "Abstract:As interest in metadata-hiding communication grows in both research and practice, a need exists for stronger abuse reporting features on metadata-hiding platforms. While message franking has been deployed on major end-to-end encrypted platforms as a lightweight and effective abuse reporting feature, there is no comparable technique for metadata-hiding platforms. Existing efforts to support abuse reporting in this setting, such as asymmetric message franking or the Hecate scheme, require order of magnitude increases in client and server computation or fundamental changes to the architecture of messaging systems. As a result, while metadata-hiding communication inches closer to practice, critical content moderation concerns remain unaddressed.This paper demonstrates that, for broad classes of metadata-hiding schemes, lightweight abuse reporting can be deployed with minimal changes to the overall architecture of the system. Our insight is that much of the structure needed to support abuse reporting already exists in these schemes. By taking a non-generic approach, we can reuse this structure to achieve abuse reporting with minimal overhead. In particular, we show how to modify schemes based on secret sharing user inputs to support a message franking-style protocol. Compared to prior work, our shared franking technique more than halves the time to prepare a franked message and gives order of magnitude reductions in server-side message processing times, as well as in the time to decrypt a message and verify a report.",

    "title": "Notus: Dynamic Proofs of Liabilities from Zero-knowledge RSA Accumulators",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Proofs of Liabilities (PoL) allow an untrusted prover to commit to its liabilities towards a set of users and then prove independent users' amounts or the total sum of liabilities, upon queries by users or third-party auditors. This application setting is highly dynamic. User liabilities may increase/decrease arbitrarily and the prover needs to update proofs in epoch increments (e.g., once a day for a crypto-asset exchange platform). However, prior works mostly focus on the static case and trivial extensions to the dynamic setting open the system to windows of opportunity for the prover to under-report its liabilities and rectify its books in time for the next check, unless all users check their liabilities at all epochs. In this work, we develop Notus, the first dynamic PoL system for general liability updates that avoids this issue. Moreover, it achieves O(1) query proof size, verification time, and auditor overhead-per-epoch. The core building blocks underlying Notus are a novel zero-knowledge (and SNARK-friendly) RSA accumulator and a corresponding zero-knowledge MultiSwap protocol, which may be of independent interest. We then propose optimizations to reduce the prover's update overhead and make Notus scale to large numbers of users (10^6 in our experiments). Our results are very encouraging, e.g., it takes less than 2ms to verify a user's liability and the proof size is 256 Bytes. On the prover side, deploying Notus on a cloud-based testbed with 256 cores and exploiting parallelism, it takes about 3 minutes to perform the complete epoch update, after which all proofs have already been computed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Dynamic Searchable Encryption (DSE) has emerged as a solution to efficiently handle and protect large-scale data storage in encrypted databases (EDBs). Volume leakage poses a significant threat, as it enables adversaries to reconstruct search queries and potentially compromise the security and privacy of data. Padding strategies are common countermeasures for the leakage, but they significantly increase storage and communication costs. In this work, we develop a new perspective on handling volume leakage. We start with distinct search and further explore a new concept called distinct DSE (d-DSE).We also define new security notions, in particular Distinct with Volume-Hiding security, as well as forward and backward privacy, for the new concept. Based on d-DSE, we construct the d-DSE designed EDB with related constructions for distinct keyword (d-KW-dDSE), keyword (KW-dDSE), and join queries (JOIN-dDSE) and update queries in encrypted databases. We instantiate a concrete scheme BF-SRE, employing Symmetric Revocable Encryption. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, such as Crime, Wikipedia, and Enron, for performance evaluation. The results demonstrate that our scheme is practical in data search and with comparable computational performance to the SOTA DSE scheme (MITRA*, AURA) and padding strategies (SEAL, ShieldDB). Furthermore, our proposal sharply reduces the communication cost as compared to padding strategies, with roughly 6.36 to 53.14x advantage for search queries.",

    "title": "Racing for TLS Certificate Validation: A Hijacker's Guide to the Android TLS Galaxy",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Besides developers' code, current Android apps usually integrate code from third-party libraries, all of which may include code for TLS validation. We analyze well-known improper TLS certificate validation issues in popular Android apps, and attribute the validation issues to the offending code/party in a fine-grained manner, unlike existing work labelling an entire app for validation failures. Surprisingly, we discovered a widely used practice of overriding the global default validation functions with improper validation logic, or simply performing no validation at all, affecting the entire app's TLS connections, which we call validation hijacking. We design and implement an automated dynamic analysis tool called Marvin to identify TLS validation failures, including validation hijacking, and the responsible parties behind such dangerous practice. We use Marvin to analyze 6315 apps from a Chinese app store and Google Play, and find many occurrences of insecure TLS certificate validation instances (55.7% of the Chinese apps and 4.6% of the Google Play apps). Validation hijacking happens in 34.3% of the insecure apps from the Chinese app store and 20.0% of insecure Google Play apps. A network attacker can exploit these insecure connections in various ways, e.g., to compromise PII, app login and SSO credentials, to launch phishing and other content modification attacks, including code injection. We found that most of these vulnerabilities are related to third-party libraries used by the apps, not the app code created by app developers. The technical root cause enabling validation hijacking appears to be the specific modifications made by Google in the OkHttp library integrated with the Android OS, which is used by many developers by default, without being aware of its potential dangers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the responsible parties for TLS validation issues in Android, including the validation hijacking problem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The number and complexity of Trusted Applications (TAs, applications running in Trusted Execution Environments—TEEs) deployed on mobile devices has exploded. A vulnerability in a single TA impacts the security of the entire device. Thus, vendors must rapidly fix such vulnerabilities and revoke vulnerable versions to prevent rollback attacks, i.e., loading an old version of the TA to exploit a known vulnerability.In this paper, we assess the state of TA rollback prevention by conducting a large-scale cross-vendor study. First, we establish the largest TA dataset in existence, encompassing 35,541 TAs obtained from 1,330 firmware images deployed on mobile devices across the top five most common vendors. Second, we identify 37 TA vulnerabilities that we leverage to assess the state of industry-wide TA rollback effectiveness. Third, we make the counterintuitive discovery that the uncoordinated usage of rollback prevention correlates with the leakage of security-critical information and has far-reaching consequences potentially negatively impacting the whole mobile ecosystem. Fourth, we demonstrate the severity of ineffective TA rollback prevention by exploiting two different TEEs on fully-updated mobile devices. In summary, our results indicate severe deficiencies in TA rollback prevention across the mobile ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Decompilers, one of the widely used security tools, transform low-level binary programs back into their high-level source representations, such as C/C++. While state-of-the-art decompilers try to generate more human-readable outputs, for instance, by eliminating goto statements in their decompiled code, the correctness of a decompilation process is largely ignored due to the complexity of decompilers, e.g., involving hundreds of heuristic rules. As a result, outputs from decompilers are often not accurate, which affects the effectiveness of downstream security tasks.In this paper, we propose D-HELIX, a generic decompiler testing framework that can automatically vet the decompilation correctness on the function level. D-HELIX uses RECOMPILER to compile the decompiled code at the functional level. It then uses SYMDIFF to compare the symbolic model of the original binary with the one of the decompiled code, detecting potential errors introduced by the decompilation process. D-HELIX further provides TUNER to help debug the incorrect decompilation via toggling decompilation heuristic rules automatically. We evaluated D-HELIX on Ghidra and angr using 2,004 binaries and object files ending up with 93K decompiled functions in total. D-HELIX detected 4,515 incorrectly decompiled functions, reproduced 8 known bugs, found 17 distinct previously unknown bugs within these two decompilers, and fixed 7 bugs automatically.",

    "title": "\"These results must be false\": A usability evaluation of constant-time analysis tools",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Cryptography secures our online interactions, transactions, and trust. To achieve this goal, not only do the cryptographic primitives and protocols need to be secure in theory, they also need to be securely implemented by cryptographic library developers in practice.However, implementing cryptographic algorithms securely is challenging, even for skilled professionals, which can lead to vulnerable implementations, especially to side-channel attacks. Fortiming attacks, a severe class of side-channel attacks, there exist a multitude of tools that are supposed to help cryptographic library developers assess whether their code is vulnerable to timing attacks. Previous work has established that despite an interest in writing constant-time code, cryptographic library developers do not routinely use these tools due to their general lack of usability. However, the precise factors affecting the usability of these tools remain unexplored. While many of the tools are developed in an academic context, we believe that it is worth exploring the factors that contribute to or hinder their effective use by cryptographic library developers.To assess what contributes to and detracts from usability of tools that verify constant-timeness (CT), we conducted a two-part usability study with 24 (post) graduate student participants on 6 tools across diverse tasks that approximate real-world use cases for cryptographic library developers.We find that all studied tools are affected by similar usability issues to varying degrees, with no tool excelling in usability, and usability issues preventing their effective use.Based on our results, we recommend that effective tools for verifying CT need usable documentation, simple installation, easy to adapt examples, clear output corresponding to CT violations, and minimal noninvasive code markup. We contribute first steps to achieving these with limited academic resources, with our documentation, examples, and installation scripts.",

Reef supports the Perl Compatible Regular Expression syntax, including wildcards, alternation, ranges, capture groups, Kleene star, negations, and lookarounds. Reef introduces a new type of automata, Skipping Alternating Finite Automata (SAFA), that skips irrelevant parts of a document when producing proofs without undermining soundness, and instantiates SAFA with a lookup argument.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Anonymous message delivery, as in privacy-preserving blockchain and private messaging applications, needs to protect recipient metadata: eavesdroppers should not be able to link messages to their recipients. This raises the question: how can untrusted servers assist in delivering the pertinent messages to each recipient, without learning which messages are addressed to whom?Recent work constructed Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR) protocols that outsource the message detection and retrieval in a privacy-preserving way, using homomorphic encryption. Their construction exhibits significant costs in computation per message scanned (∼0.1 second), as well as in the size of the associated messages (∼1kB overhead) and public keys (∼132kB).This work constructs more efficient OMR schemes, by replacing the LWE-based clue encryption of prior works with a Ring-LWE variant, and utilizing the resulting flexibility to improve several components of the scheme. We thus devise, analyze, and benchmark two protocols:The first protocol focuses on improving the detector runtime, using a new retrieval circuit that can be homomorphically evaluated 15x faster than the prior work.The second protocol focuses on reducing the communication costs, by designing a different homomorphic decryption circuit that allows the parameter of the Ring-LWE encryption to be set such that the public key size is about 235x smaller than the prior work, and the message size is roughly 1.6x smaller. The runtime of this second construction is ∼40.0ms per message, still more than 2.5x faster than prior works.",

By leveraging state of the art NLP techniques, we examine what users have been writing about privacy along multiple dimensions: time, countries, app types, diverse privacy topics, and even across a spectrum of emotions. We find consistent growth of privacy-relevant reviews, and explore topics that are trending (such as Data Deletion and Data Theft), as well as those on the decline (such as privacy-relevant reviews on sensitive permissions). We find that although privacy reviews come from more than 200 countries, 33 countries provide 90% of privacy reviews. We conduct a comparison across countries by examining the distribution of privacy topics a country's users write about, and find that geographic proximity is not a reliable indicator that nearby countries have similar privacy perspectives. We uncover some countries with unique patterns and explore those herein. Surprisingly, we uncover that it is not uncommon for reviews that discuss privacy to be positive (32%); many users express pleasure about privacy features within apps or privacy-focused apps. We also uncover some unexpected behaviors, such as the use of reviews to deliver privacy disclaimers to developers. Finally, we demonstrate the value of analyzing app reviews with our approach as a complement to existing methods for understanding users' perspectives about privacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Transport Layer Security (TLS) establishes an authenticated and confidential channel to deliver data for almost all Internet applications. A recent work (Zhang et al., CCS'20) proposed a protocol to prove the TLS payload to a third party, without any modification of TLS servers, while ensuring the privacy and originality of the data in the presence of malicious adversaries. However, it required maliciously secure Two-Party Computation (2PC) for generic circuits, leading to significant computational and communication overhead.This paper proposes the garble-then-prove technique to achieve the same security requirement without using any heavy mechanism like generic malicious 2PC. Our end-to-end implementation shows 14x improvement in communication and an order of magnitude improvement in computation over the state-of-the-art protocol. We also show worldwide performance when using our protocol to authenticate payload data from Coinbase and Twitter APIs. Finally, we propose an efficient gadget to privately convert the above authenticated TLS payload to additively homomorphic commitments so that the properties of the payload can be proven efficiently using zkSNARKs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Text-to-Image generation models have revolutionized the artwork design process and enabled anyone to create high-quality images by entering text descriptions called prompts. Creating a high-quality prompt that consists of a subject and several modifiers can be time-consuming and costly. In consequence, a trend of trading high-quality prompts on specialized marketplaces has emerged. In this paper, we perform the first study on understanding the threat of a novel attack, namely prompt stealing attack, which aims to steal prompts from generated images by text-to-image generation models. Successful prompt stealing attacks directly violate the intellectual property of prompt engineers and jeopardize the business model of prompt marketplaces. We first perform a systematic analysis on a dataset collected by ourselves and show that a successful prompt stealing attack should consider a prompt's subject as well as its modifiers. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective prompt stealing attack, PromptStealer. It consists of two modules: a subject generator trained to infer the subject and a modifier detector for identifying the modifiers within the generated image. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptStealer is superior over three baseline methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also make some initial attempts to defend PromptStealer. In general, our study uncovers a new attack vector within the ecosystem established by the popular text-to-image generation models. We hope our results can contribute to understanding and mitigating this emerging threat.",

    "title": "Trust Me If You Can – How Usable Is Trusted Types In Practice?",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Many online services deal with sensitive information such as credit card data, making those applications a prime target for adversaries, e.g., through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Moreover, Web applications nowadays deploy their functionality via client-side code to lower the server's load, require fewer page reloads, and allow Web applications to work even if the connection is interrupted. Given this paradigm shift of increasing complexity on the browser side, client-side security issues such as client-side XSS are getting more prominent these days. A solution already deployed in server-side applications of major companies like Google is to use type-safe data, where potentially attacker-controlled string data can never be output with sanitization. The newly introduced Trusted Types API offers an analogous solution for client-side XSS. With Trusted Types, the browser enforces that no input can be passed to an execution sink without being sanitized first. Thus, a developer's only remaining task – in theory – is to create a proper sanitizer. This study aims to uncover roadblocks that occur during the deployment of the mechanism and strategies on how developers can circumvent those problems by conducting a semi-structured interview, including a coding task with 13 real-world Web developers. Our work also identifies key weaknesses in the design and documentation of Trusted Types, which we urge the standard- ization body to incorporate before the Trusted Types becomes a standard.",

These countermeasures, although effective against some Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) relays, fail to prevent physical-layer relay attacks.In this work, we leverage the Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) radios incorporated in major smartphones, smartwatches, tags and accessories, and introduce PURE, the first UWB-based relay protection that integrates smoothly into existing contactless payment standards, and prevents even the most sophisticated physical layer attacks. PURE extends EMV payment protocols that are executed between cards and terminals, and does not require any modification to the backend of the issuer, acquirer, or payment network. PURE further tailors UWB ranging to the payment environment (i.e., wireless channels) to achieve both reliability and resistance to all known physical-layer distance reduction attacks against UWB 802.15.4z. We implement PURE within the EMV standard on modern smartphones, and evaluate its performance in a realistic deployment. Our experiments show that PURE provides a sub-meter relay protection with minimal execution overhead (41 ms). We formally verify the security of PURE's integration within Mastercard's EMV protocol using the Tamarin prover.",

    "title": "A Binary-level Thread Sanitizer or Why Sanitizing on the Binary Level is Hard",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Dynamic software testing methods, such as fuzzing, have become a popular and effective method for detecting many types of faults in programs. While most research focuses on targets for which source code is available, much of the software used in practice is only available as closed source. Testing software without having access to source code forces a user to resort to binary-only testing methods, which are typically slower and lack support for crucial features, such as advanced bug oracles in the form of sanitizers, i.e., dynamic methods to detect faults based on undefined or suspicious behavior. Almost all existing sanitizers work by injecting instrumentation at compile time, requiring access to the target's source code. In this paper, we systematically identify the key challenges of applying sanitizers to binary-only targets. As a result of our analysis, we present the design and implementation of BINTSAN, an approach to realize the data race detector TSAN targeting binary-only Linux x86-64 targets. We systematically evaluate BINTSAN for correctness, effectiveness, and performance. We find that our approach has a runtime overhead of only 15% compared to source-based TSAN. Compared to existing binary solutions, our approach has better performance (up to 5.0× performance improvement) and precision, while preserving compatibility with the compiler-based TSAN.",

    "title": "Unbalanced Circuit-PSI from Oblivious Key-Value Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Circuit-based Private Set Intersection (circuit-PSI) empowers two parties, a client and a server, each with input sets X and Y, to securely compute a function f on the intersection X∩Y while preserving the confidentiality of X∩Y from both parties. Despite the recent proposals of computationally efficient circuit-PSI protocols, they primarily focus on the balanced scenario where |X| is similar to |Y|. However, in many practical situations, a circuit-PSI protocol may be applied in an unbalanced context, where |X| is significantly smaller than |Y|. Directly applying existing protocols to this scenario poses notable efficiency challenges due to the communication complexity of these protocols scaling at least linearly with the size of the larger set, i.e., max(|X|,|Y|).In this work, we put forth efficient constructions for unbalanced circuit-PSI, demonstrating sublinear communication complexity in the size of the larger set. Our key insight lies in formalizing unbalanced circuit-PSI as the process of obliviously retrieving values corresponding to keys from a set of key-value pairs. To achieve this, we propose a new functionality named Oblivious Key-Value Retrieval (OKVR) and design the OKVR protocol based on a new notion termed sparse Oblivious Key-Value Store (sparse OKVS). We conduct comprehensive experiments and the results showcase substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art circuit-PSI schemes, i.e., 1.84∼48.86x communication improvement and 1.50∼39.81x faster computation. Compared to a very recent unbalanced circuit-PSI work, our constructions outperform them by 1.18∼15.99x and 1.22∼10.44x in communication and computation overhead, respectively, depending on set sizes and network environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The lack of trust is one of the major factors that hinder collaboration among Internet of Things (IoT) devices and harness the usage of the vast amount of data generated. Traditional methods rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), managed by centralized certification authorities (CAs), which suffer from scalability issues, single points of failure, and limited interoperability. To address these concerns, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) have been proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the European Union as viable solutions for promoting decentralization and \"electronic IDentification, Authentication, and trust Services\" (eIDAS). Nevertheless, at the state-of-the-art, there are no efficient revocation mechanisms for VCs specifically tailored for IoT devices, which are characterized by limited connectivity, storage, and computational power.This paper presents EVOKE, an efficient revocation mechanism of VCs in IoT networks. EVOKE leverages an ECC-based accumulator to manage VCs with minimal computing and storage overhead while offering additional features like mass and offline revocation. We designed, implemented, and evaluated a prototype of EVOKE across various deployment scenarios. Our experiments on commodity IoT devices demonstrate that each device only requires minimal storage (i.e., approximately 1.5 KB) to maintain verification information, and most notably half the storage required by the most efficient PKI certificates. Moreover, our experiments on hybrid networks, representing typical IoT protocols (e.g., Zigbee), also show minimal latency in the order of milliseconds. Finally, our large-scale analysis demonstrates that even when 50% of devices missed updates, approximately 96% of devices in the entire network were updated within the first hour, proving the scalability of EVOKE in offline updates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:BusyBox, an open-source software bundling over 300 essential Linux commands into a single executable, is ubiquitous in Linux-based embedded devices. Vulnerabilities in BusyBox can have far-reaching consequences, affecting a wide array of devices. This research, driven by the extensive use of BusyBox, delved into its analysis. The study revealed the prevalence of older BusyBox versions in real-world embedded products, prompting us to conduct fuzz testing on BusyBox. Fuzzing, a pivotal software testing method, aims to induce crashes that are subsequently scrutinized to uncover vulnerabilities. Within this study, we introduce two techniques to fortify software testing. The first technique enhances fuzzing by leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) to generate target-specific initial seeds. Our study showed a substantial increase in crashes when using LLM-generated initial seeds, highlighting the potential of LLM to efficiently tackle the typically labor-intensive task of generating target-specific initial seeds. The second technique involves repurposing previously acquired crash data from similar fuzzed targets before initiating fuzzing on a new target. This approach streamlines the time-consuming fuzz testing process by providing crash data directly to the new target before commencing fuzzing. We successfully identified crashes in the latest BusyBox target without conducting traditional fuzzing, emphasizing the effectiveness of LLM and crash reuse techniques in enhancing software testing and improving vulnerability detection in embedded systems. Additionally, manual triaging was performed to identify the nature of crashes in the latest BusyBox.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:AMD has gained a significant market share in recent years with the introduction of the Zen microarchitecture. While there are many recent Rowhammer attacks launched from Intel CPUs, they are completely absent on these newer AMD CPUs due to three non-trivial challenges: 1) reverse engineering the unknown DRAM addressing functions, 2) synchronizing with refresh commands for evading in-DRAM mitigations, and 3) achieving a sufficient row activation throughput. We address these challenges in the design of ZenHammer, the first Rowhammer attack on recent AMD CPUs. ZenHammer reverse engineers DRAM addressing functions despite their non-linear nature, uses specially crafted access patterns for proper synchronization, and carefully schedules flush and fence instructions within a pattern to increase the activation throughput while preserving the access order necessary to bypass in-DRAM mitigations. Our evaluation with ten DDR4 devices shows that ZenHammer finds bit flips on seven and six devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3, respectively, enabling Rowhammer exploitation on current AMD platforms. Furthermore, ZenHammer triggers Rowhammer bit flips on a DDR5 device for the first time.",

Unfortunately, the design and implementation of such mechanisms are complicated and error-prone, potentially exposing Web applications to security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a practical framework to formally and automatically detect security flaws in client-side security mechanisms. In particular, we leverage Web Platform Tests (WPT), a popular cross-browser test suite, to automatically collect browser execution traces and match them against Web invariants, i.e., intended security properties of Web mechanisms expressed in first-order logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by validating 9 invariants against the WPT test suite, discovering violations with clear security implications in 104 tests for Firefox, Chromium and Safari. We disclosed the root causes of these violations to browser vendors and standard bodies, which resulted in 8 individual reports and one CVE on Safari.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:As control-flow hijacking is getting harder due to increasingly sophisticated CFI solutions, recent work has instead focused on automatically building data-only attacks, typically using symbolic execution, simplifying assumptions that do not always match the attacker's goals, manual gadget chaining, or all of the above. As a result, the practical adoption of such methods is minimal. In this work, we abstract away unnecessary complexities and instead use a lightweight approach that targets the vulnerabilities that are both the most tractable for analysis, and the most promising for an attacker.In particular, we present Einstein, a data-only attack exploitation pipeline that uses dynamic taint analysis policies to: (i) scan for chains of vulnerable system calls (e.g., to execute code or corrupt the filesystem), and (ii) generate exploits for those that take unmodified attacker data as input. Einstein discovers thousands of vulnerable syscalls in common server applications—well beyond the reach of existing approaches. Moreover, using nginx as a case study, we use Einstein to generate 944 exploits, and we discuss two such exploits that bypass state-of-the-art mitigations.",

    "title": "LaKey: Efficient Lattice-Based Distributed PRFs Enable Scalable Distributed Key Management",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Distributed key management (DKM) services are multi-party services that allow their users to outsource the generation, storage, and usage of cryptographic private keys, while guaranteeing that none of the involved service providers learn the private keys in the clear. This is typically achieved through distributed key generation (DKG) protocols, where the service providers generate the keys on behalf of the users in an interactive protocol, and each of the servers stores a share of each key as the result. However, with traditional DKM systems, the key material stored by each server grows linearly with the number of users.An alternative approach to DKM is via distributed key derivation (DKD) where the user key shares are derived on-demand from a constant-size (in the number of users) secret-shared master key and the corresponding user's identity, which is achieved by employing a suitable distributed pseudorandom function (dPRF). However, existing suitable dPRFs require on the order of 100 interaction rounds between the servers and are therefore insufficient for settings with high network latency and where users demand real-time interaction.To resolve the situation, we initiate the study of lattice-based distributed PRFs, with a particular focus on their application to DKD. Concretely, we show that the LWE-based PRF presented by Boneh et al. at CRYPTO'13 can be turned into a distributed PRF suitable for DKD that runs in only 8 online rounds, which is an improvement over the start-of-the-art by an order of magnitude. We further present optimizations of this basic construction. We show a new construction with improved communication efficiency proven secure under the same \"standard\" assumptions. Then, we present even more efficient constructions, running in as low as 5 online rounds, from non-standard, new lattice-based assumptions. We support our findings by implementing and evaluating our protocol using the MP-SPDZ framework (Keller, CCS '20). Finally, we give a formal definition of our DKD in the UC framework and prove a generic construction (for which our construction qualifies) secure in this model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Utilizing sensitive images (e.g., human faces) for training DL models raises privacy concerns. One straightforward solution is to replace the private images with synthetic ones generated by deep generative models. Among all image synthesis methods, diffusion models (DMs) yield impressive performance. Unfortunately, recent studies have revealed that DMs incur privacy challenges due to the memorization of the training instances. To preserve the existence of a single private sample of DMs, many works have explored to apply DP on DMs from different perspectives. However, existing works on differentially private DMs only consider DMs as regular deep models, such that they inject unnecessary DP noise in addition to the forward process noise in DMs, damaging the model utility. To address the issue, this paper proposes Differentially Private Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Synthesis, dp-promise, which theoretically guarantees approximate DP by leveraging the DM noise during the forward process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, given the same privacy budget, dp-promise outperforms the state-of-the-art on the image quality of differentially private image synthesis across the standard metrics and datasets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Honeywords are decoy passwords that can be added to a credential database; if a login attempt uses a honeyword, this indicates that the site's credential database has been leaked. In this paper we explore the basic requirements for honeywords to be effective, in a threat model where the attacker knows passwords for the same users at other sites. First, we show that for user-chosen (vs. algorithmically generated, i.e., by a password manager) passwords, existing honeyword-generation algorithms do not simultaneously achieve false-positive and false-negative rates near their ideals of ≈0 and ≈ 1/1+n, respectively, in this threat model, where n is the number of honeywords per account. Second, we show that for users leveraging algorithmically generated passwords, state-of-the-art methods for honeyword generation will produce honeywords that are not sufficiently deceptive, yielding many false negatives. Instead, we find that only a honeyword-generation algorithm that uses the same password generator as the user can provide deceptive honeywords in this case. However, when the defender's ability to infer the generator from the (one) account password is less accurate than the attacker's ability to infer the generator from potentially many, this deception can again wane. Taken together, our results provide a cautionary note for the state of honeyword research and pose new challenges to the field.",

While participants hoped to learn either about their own usage of the platform or how the company collects and uses their personal data, these questions were often left unanswered. Participants' annotations documented their excitement at finding data records that triggered nostalgia, but also shock and anger about the privacy implications of other data they saw.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Microarchitectural side-channel attacks have shaken the foundations of modern processor design. The cornerstone defense against these attacks has been to ensure that security-critical programs do not use secret-dependent data as addresses. Put simply: do not pass secrets as addresses to, e.g., data memory instructions. Yet, the discovery of data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs)—which turn program data into addresses directly from within the memory system—calls into question whether this approach will continue to remain secure.This paper shows that the security threat from DMPs is significantly worse than previously thought and demonstrates the first end-to-end attacks on security-critical software using the Apple m-series DMP. Undergirding our attacks is a new understanding of how DMPs behave which shows, among other things, that the Apple DMP will activate on behalf of any victim program and attempt to \"leak\" any cached data that resembles a pointer. From this understanding, we design a new type of chosen-input attack that uses the DMP to perform end-to-end key extraction on popular constant-time implementations of classical (OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Go RSA decryption) and post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Double-fetch bugs (or vulnerabilities) stem from in-kernel system call execution fetching the same user data twice without proper data (re)sanitization, enabling TOCTTOU attacks and posing a major threat to operating systems security. Existing double-fetch protection systems rely on the MMU to trap on writes to syscall-accessed user pages and provide the kernel with a consistent snapshot of user memory. While this strategy can hinder attacks, it also introduces nontrivial runtime performance overhead due to the cost of trapping/remapping and the coarse (page-granular) write interposition mechanism.In this paper, we propose SafeFetch, a practical solution to protect the kernel from double-fetch bugs. The key intuition is that most system calls fetch small amounts of user data (if at all), hence caching this data in the kernel can be done at a small performance cost. To this end, SafeFetch creates per-syscall caches to persist fetched user data and replay them when they are fetched again within the same syscall. This strategy neutralizes all double-fetch bugs, while eliminating trapping/remapping overheads and relying on efficient byte-granular interposition. Our Linux prototype evaluation shows SafeFetch can provide comprehensive protection with low performance overheads (e.g., 4.4% geomean on LMBench), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Deepfake media represents an important and growing threat not only to computing systems but to society at large. Datasets of image, video, and voice deepfakes are being created to assist researchers in building strong defenses against these emerging threats. However, despite the growing number of datasets and the relative diversity of their samples, little guidance exists to help researchers select datasets and then meaningfully contrast their results against prior efforts. To assist in this process, this paper presents the first systematization of deepfake media. Using traditional anomaly detection datasets as a baseline, we characterize the metrics, generation techniques, and class distributions of existing datasets. Through this process, we discover significant problems impacting the comparability of systems using these datasets, including unaccounted-for heavy class imbalance and reliance upon limited metrics. These observations have a potentially profound impact should such systems be transitioned to practice - as an example, we demonstrate that the widely-viewed best detector applied to a typical call center scenario would result in only 1 out of 333 flagged results being a true positive. To improve reproducibility and future comparisons, we provide a template for reporting results in this space and advocate for the release of model score files such that a wider range of statistics can easily be found and/or calculated. Through this, and our recommendations for improving dataset construction, we provide important steps to move this community forward.",

At the same time, there are also concerns on the potential misuse of this powerful technology, prompting defensive measures from service providers. To overcome such protection, jailbreaking prompts have recently emerged as one of the most effective mechanisms to circumvent security restrictions and elicit harmful content originally designed to be prohibited.Due to the rapid development of LLMs and their ease of access via natural languages, the frontline of jailbreak prompts is largely seen in online forums and among hobbyists. To gain a better understanding of the threat landscape of semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts, we systemized existing prompts and measured their jailbreak effectiveness empirically. Further, we conducted a user study involving 92 participants with diverse backgrounds to unveil the process of manually creating jailbreak prompts. We observed that users often succeeded in jailbreak prompts generation regardless of their expertise in LLMs. Building on the insights from the user study, we also developed a system using AI as the assistant to automate the process of jailbreak prompt generation.",

Though the Linux kernel allocator has some security designs in place to counter exploitation, our analytical experiments reveal that they can barely provide the expected results. This shortfall is rooted in the current strategy of designing secure kernel allocators which insists on protecting every object all the time. Such strategy inherently conflicts with the kernel nature. To this end, we advocate for rethinking the design of secure kernel allocator. In this work, we explore a new strategy which centers around the \"atomic alleviation\" concept, featuring flexibility and efficiency in design and deployment. Recent advancements in kernel design and research outcomes on exploitation techniques enable us to prototype this strategy in a tool named SeaK. We used real-world cases to thoroughly evaluate SeaK. The results validate that SeaK substantially strengthens heap security, outperforming all existing features, without incurring noticeable performance and memory cost. Besides, SeaK shows excellent scalability and stability in the production scenario.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) devices has created a system of convenience, which allows users to control and automate almost everything in their homes. But this increase in convenience comes with increased security risks to the users of IoT devices, partially because IoT firmware is frequently complex, feature-rich, and very vulnerable. Existing solutions for automatically finding taint-style vulnerabilities significantly reduce the number of binaries analyzed to achieve scalability. However, we show that this trade-off results in missing significant numbers of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a new direction: scaling static analysis of firmware binaries so that all binaries can be analyzed for command injection or buffer overflows. To achieve this, we developed MANGODFA, a novel binary data-flow analysis leveraging value analysis and data dependency analysis on binary code. Through key algorithmic optimizations in MANGODFA, our prototype Mango achieves fast analysis without sacrificing precision. On the same dataset used in prior work, Mango analyzed 27× more binaries in a comparable amount of time to the state-of-the-art in Linux-based user-space firmware taint-analysis SaTC. Mango achieved an average per-binary analysis time of 8 minutes compared to 6.56 hours for SaTC. In addition, Mango finds 56 real vulnerabilities that SaTC does not find in a set of seven firmware. We also performed an ablation study demonstrating the performance gains in Mango come from key algorithmic improvements.",

    "title": "Security and Privacy Software Creators' Perspectives on Unintended Consequences",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Security & Privacy (S&P) software is created to have positive impacts on people: to protect them from surveillance and attacks, enhance their privacy, and keep them safe. Despite these positive intentions, S&P software can have unintended consequences, such as enabling and protecting criminals, misleading people into using the software with a false sense of security, and being inaccessible to users without strong technical backgrounds or with specific accessibility needs. In this study, through 14 semi-structured expert interviews with S&P software creators, we explore whether and how S&P software creators foresee and mitigate unintended consequences. We find that unintended consequences are often overlooked and ignored. When addressed, they are done in unstructured ways—often ad hoc and just based on user feedback—thereby shifting the burden to users. To reduce this burden on users and more effectively create positive change, we recommend S&P software creators to proactively consider and mitigate unintended consequences through increasing awareness and education, promoting accountability at the organizational level to mitigate issues, and using systematic toolkits for anticipating impacts.",

    "title": "Exploring digital security and privacy in relative poverty in Germany through qualitative interviews",
    "abstract": "Abstract:When developing security and privacy policy, technical solutions, and research for end users, assumptions about end users' financial means and technology use situations often fail to take users' income status into account. This means that the status quo may marginalize those affected by poverty in security and privacy, and exacerbate inequalities. To enable more equitable security and privacy for all, it is crucial to understand the overall situation of low income users, their security and privacy concerns, perceptions, behaviors, and challenges. In this paper, we report on a semi-structured, in-depth interview study with low income users living in Germany (n=28) which we understand as a case study for the growing number of low income users in global north countries. We find that low income end users may be literate regarding technology use and possess solid basic knowledge about security and privacy, and generally show awareness of security and privacy threats and risks. Despite these resources, we also find that low income users are driven to poor security and privacy practices like using an untrusted cloud due to little storage space, and relying on old, broken, or used hardware. Additionally we find the mindset of a—potentially false—sense of security and privacy because through attacking them, there is \"not much to get\". Based on our findings, we discuss how the security and privacy community can expand comprehension about diverse end users, increase awareness and design for the specific situation of low income users, and should take more vulnerable groups into account.",

    "title": "Enabling Contextual Soft Moderation on Social Media through Contrastive Textual Deviation",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Automated soft moderation systems are unable to ascertain if a post supports or refutes a false claim, resulting in a large number of contextual false positives. This limits their effectiveness, for example undermining trust in health experts by adding warnings to their posts or resorting to vague warnings instead of granular fact-checks, which result in desensitizing users. In this paper, we propose to incorporate stance detection into existing automated soft-moderation pipelines, with the goal of ruling out contextual false positives and providing more precise recommendations for social media content that should receive warnings. We develop a textual deviation task called Contrastive Textual Deviation (CTD), and show that it outperforms existing stance detection approaches when applied to soft moderation. We then integrate CTD into the state-of-the-art system for automated soft moderation Lambretta, showing that our approach can reduce contextual false positives from 20% to 2.1%, providing another important building block towards deploying reliable automated soft moderation tools on social media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Hardware-based Trusted execution environments (TEEs) offer an isolation granularity of virtual machine abstraction. They provide confidential VMs (CVMs) that host security-sensitive code and data. AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX enable CVMs and are now available on popular cloud platforms. The untrusted hypervisor in these settings is in control of several resource management and configuration tasks, including interrupts. We present HECKLER, a new attack wherein the hypervisor injects malicious non-timer interrupts to break the confidentiality and integrity of CVMs. Our insight is to use the interrupt handlers that have global effects, such that we can manipulate a CVM's register states to change the data and control flow. With AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX, we demonstrate HECKLER on OpenSSH and sudo to bypass authentication. On AMD SEV-SNP we break execution integrity of C, Java, and Julia applications that perform statistical and text analysis. We explain the gaps in current defenses and outline guidelines for future defenses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Machine learning (ML) is vulnerable to inference (e.g., membership inference, property inference, and data reconstruction) attacks that aim to infer the private information of training data or dataset. Existing defenses are only designed for one specific type of attack and sacrifice significant utility or are soon broken by adaptive attacks. We address these limitations by proposing an information-theoretic defense framework, called Inf2Guard, against the three major types of inference attacks. Our framework, inspired by the success of representation learning, posits that learning shared representations not only saves time/costs but also benefits numerous downstream tasks. Generally, Inf2Guard involves two mutual information objectives, for privacy protection and utility preservation, respectively. Inf2Guard exhibits many merits: it facilitates the design of customized objectives against the specific inference attack; it provides a general defense framework which can treat certain existing defenses as special cases; and importantly, it aids in deriving theoretical results, e.g., inherent utility-privacy tradeoff and guaranteed privacy leakage. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness of Inf2Guard for learning privacy-preserving representations against inference attacks and demonstrate the superiority over the baselines.",

    "title": "Snowflake, a censorship circumvention system using temporary WebRTC proxies",
    "abstract": "Abstract:Snowflake is a system for circumventing Internet censorship. Its blocking resistance comes from the use of numerous, ultra-light, temporary proxies (\"snowflakes\"), which accept traffic from censored clients using peer-to-peer WebRTC protocols and forward it to a centralized bridge. The temporary proxies are simple enough to be implemented in JavaScript, in a web page or browser extension, making them much cheaper to run than a traditional proxy or VPN server. The large and changing pool of proxy addresses resists enumeration and blocking by a censor. The system is designed with the assumption that proxies may appear or disappear at any time. Clients discover proxies dynamically using a secure rendezvous protocol. When an in-use proxy goes offline, its client switches to another on the fly, invisibly to upper network layers.Snowflake has been deployed with success in Tor Browser and Orbot for several years. It has been a significant circumvention tool during high-profile network disruptions, including in Russia in 2021 and Iran in 2022. In this paper, we explain the composition of Snowflake's many parts, give a history of deployment and blocking attempts, and reflect on implications for circumvention generally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) enables the training and inference of models on private data, addressing security concerns in machine learning. PPML based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) has garnered significant attention from both the academic and industrial communities. Nevertheless, only a few PPML works provide malicious security with a dishonest majority. The state of the art by Damgårdet al.(SP'19) fails to meet the demand for large models in practice, due to insufficient efficiency. In this work, we propose MD-ML, a framework for Maliciously secure Dishonest majority PPML, with a focus on boosting online efficiency.MD-ML works for n parties, tolerating corruption of up to n-1 parties. We construct our novel protocols for PPML, including truncation, dot product, matrix multiplication, and comparison. The online communication of our dot product protocol is onesingleelement per party,independentof input length. In addition, the online cost of our multiply-then-truncate protocol isidenticalto multiplication, which means truncation incursnoadditional online cost. These features are achieved for thefirsttime in the literature concerning maliciously secure dishonest majority PPML.Benchmarking of MD-ML is conducted for SVM and NN including LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet-18. For NN inference, compared to the state of the art (Damgårdet al., SP'19), we are about 3.4—11.0x (LAN) and 9.7—157.7x (WAN) faster in online execution time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Deep Learning (DL) models have become crucial in digital transformation, thus raising concerns about their intellectual property rights. Different watermarking techniques have been developed to protect Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from IP infringement, creating a competitive field for DNN watermarking and removal methods. The predominant watermarking schemes use white-box techniques, which involve modifying weights by adding a unique signature to specific DNN layers. On the other hand, existing attacks on white-box watermarking usually require knowledge of the specific deployed watermarking scheme or access to the underlying data for further training and fine-tuning. We propose DeepEclipse, a novel and unified framework designed to remove white-box watermarks. We present obfuscation techniques that significantly differ from the existing white-box watermarking removal schemes. DeepEclipse can evade watermark detection without prior knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme, additional data, or training and fine-tuning. Our evaluation reveals that DeepEclipse excels in breaking multiple white-box watermarking schemes, reducing watermark detection to random guessing while maintaining a similar model accuracy as the original one. Our framework showcases a promising solution to address the ongoing DNN watermark protection and removal challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of natural language understanding and programming code processing tasks. Their capacity to comprehend and generate human-like code has spurred research into harnessing LLMs for code analysis purposes. However, the existing body of literature falls short in delivering a systematic evaluation and assessment of LLMs' effectiveness in code analysis, particularly in the context of obfuscated code.This paper seeks to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in performing code analysis tasks. Additionally, it presents real-world case studies that employ LLMs for code analysis. Our findings indicate that LLMs can indeed serve as valuable tools for automating code analysis, albeit with certain limitations. Through meticulous exploration, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the potential and constraints associated with utilizing LLMs in code analysis, paving the way for enhanced applications in this critical domain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been recently explored for the integrity of machine learning (ML) inference. However, these protocols suffer from high computational overhead, with the primary bottleneck stemming from the evaluation of non-linear functions. In this paper, we propose the first systematic ZK proof framework for non-linear mathematical functions in ML using the perspective of table lookup. The key challenge is that table lookup cannot be directly applied to non-linear functions in ML since it would suffer from inefficiencies due to the intolerably large table. Therefore, we carefully design several important building blocks, including digital decomposition, comparison, and truncation, such that they can effectively utilize table lookup with a quite small table size while ensuring the soundness of proofs. Based on these building blocks, we implement complex mathematical operations and further construct ZK proofs for current mainstream non-linear functions in ML such as ReLU, sigmoid, and normalization. The extensive experimental evaluation shows that our framework achieves 50∼179× runtime improvement compared to the state-of-the-art work, while maintaining a similar level of communication efficiency.",

This paper provides a systematization approach to classify existing model extraction attacks and defenses based on different threat models.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Machine learning has shown great promise in addressing several critical hardware security problems. In particular, researchers have developed novel graph neural network (GNN)-based techniques for detecting intellectual property (IP) piracy, detecting hardware Trojans (HTs), and reverse engineering circuits, to name a few. These techniques have demonstrated outstanding accuracy and have received much attention in the community. However, since these techniques are used for security applications, it is imperative to evaluate them thoroughly and ensure they are robust and do not compromise the security of integrated circuits.In this work, we proposeAttackGNN, the first red-team attack on GNN-based techniques in hardware security. To this end, we devise a novel reinforcement learning (RL) agent that generates adversarial examples, i.e., circuits, against the GNN-based techniques. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness, scalability, and generality to devise a potent RL agent. We target five GNN-based techniques for four crucial classes of problems in hardware security: IP piracy, detecting/localizing HTs, reverse engineering, and hardware obfuscation. Through our approach, we craft circuits that fool all GNNs considered in this work. For instance, to evade IP piracy detection, we generate adversarial pirated circuits that fool the GNN-based defense into classifying our crafted circuits as not pirated. For attacking HT localization GNN, our attack generates HT-infested circuits that fool the defense on all tested circuits. We obtain a similar 100% success rate against GNNs for all classes of problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Obtaining the authorization of users (i.e., data owners) prior to data collection has become commonplace for online service providers (i.e., data processors), in light of the stringent data regulations around the world. However, it remains a challenge to uphold the principle of purpose limitation, which mandates that collected data should only be processed for the purpose that the data owner has originally authorized. In this work, we advocate algorithm specificity, as a means to enforce the purpose limitation principle. We propose AlgoSpec, which obscures data to restrict its usability solely to an authorized algorithm or algorithm group. AlgoSpec exploits the nature of polynomial approximation that given the input data and the highest order, any algorithm can be approximated with a unique polynomial. It converts the original authorized algorithm (or a part of it) into a polynomial and then creates a list of alternatives to the original data. To assess the efficacy and efficiency of AlgoSpec, we apply it to the entropy method and Naive Bayes classification under datasets of different magnitudes from 10^2 to 10^6. AlgoSpec significantly outperforms cryptographic solutions such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in efficiency. On accuracy, it achieves a negligible Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.289 in the entropy method against computation over plaintext data, and identical accuracy (92.11%) and similar F1 score (87.67%) in the Naive Bayes classification.",

These apps' ambiguous nature, closely resembling legitimate subscription apps, complicates their detection in app markets. To address this, our study aims to devise an automated method, named DARKFLEECE, to identify fleeceware through their prevalent use of dark patterns. By recruiting domain experts, we curated the first-ever fleeceware feature library, based on dark patterns extracted from user interfaces (UI). A unique extraction method, which integrates UI elements, layout, and multifaceted extraction rules, has been developed. DARKFLEECE boasts a detection accuracy of 93.43% on our dataset and utilizes Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to present user-friendly alerts about potential fleeceware risks. When deployed to assess Google Play's app landscape, DARKFLEECE examined 13,597 apps and identified an alarming 75.21% of 589 subscription apps that displayed different levels of fleeceware, totaling around 5 billion downloads. Our results are consistent with user reviews on Google Play. Our detailed exploration into the implications of our results for ethical app developers, app users, and app market regulators provides crucial insights for different stakeholders.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Generative models have served as the backbone of versatile tools with a wide range of applications across various fields in recent years. However, it has been demonstrated that privacy concerns, such as membership information leakage of the training dataset, exist for generative models. In this paper, we perform property existence inference against generative models as a new type of information leakage, which aims to infer whether any samples with a given property are contained in the training set. For example, to infer if any images (i.e., samples) of a specific brand of cars (i.e., property) are used to train the target model. We focus on the leakage of existence information of properties with very low proportions in the training set, which has been overlooked in previous works. We leverage the feature-level consistency of the generated data with the training data to launch inferences and validate the property existence information leakage across diverse architectures of generative models. We have examined various factors influencing the property existence inference and investigated how generated samples leak property existence information. In our conclusion, most generative models are vulnerable to property existence inferences. Additionally, we have validated our attack in Stable Diffusion which is a large-scale open-source generative model in real-world scenarios, and demonstrated its risk of property existence information leakage.

    "abstract": "Abstract:Due to costly efforts during data acquisition and model training, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) belong to the intellectual property of the model creator. Hence, unauthorized use, theft, or modification may lead to legal repercussions. Existing DNN watermarking methods for ownership proof are often non-intuitive, embed human-invisible marks, require trust in algorithmic assessment that lacks human-understandable attributes, and rely on rigid thresholds, making it susceptible to failure in cases of partial watermark erasure.This paper introduces ClearStamp, the first DNN watermarking method designed for intuitive human assessment. ClearStamp embeds visible watermarks, enabling human decision-making without rigid value thresholds while allowing technology-assisted evaluations. ClearStamp defines a transposed model architecture allowing to use of the model in a backward fashion to interwove the watermark with the main task within all model parameters. Compared to existing watermarking methods, ClearStamp produces visual watermarks that are easy for humans to understand without requiring complex verification algorithms or strict thresholds. The watermark is embedded within all model parameters and entangled with the main task, exhibiting superior robustness. It shows an 8,544-bit watermark capacity comparable to the strongest existing work. Crucially, ClearStamp's effectiveness is model and dataset-agnostic, and resilient against adversarial model manipulations, as demonstrated in a comprehensive study performed with four datasets and seven architectures.",
